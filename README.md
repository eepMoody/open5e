# Starting the Server

The Django API uses Django REST Framework for its browsability and ease of use when developing CRUD endpoints.

## Server Quickstart

Before launching the site, it is necessary to start up the server and populate a local SQLite database.

starting from root `/open5e` directory:

``` python
cd server
export OPEN_5E_ROOT=`pwd` #set the /server folder as the root of the Python project
export DJANGO_SECRET='@pt#ouh)@!c+2eh(!aj_vtc=s7t$uk-l1!ry3^fcercz%si01@' # this should be a nukable test key that you're manually replacing at startup time for production
pipenv install
pipenv run python manage.py migrate
pipenv run python manage.py shell

# In IDLE shell
exec(open('scripts/load_srd_content.py').read())
quit()

# Back in /server
pipenv run python manage.py rebuild_index # Build the index for search results
pipenv run python manage.py runserver # Run the damn server! Hooray!
```

You will want to leave the server terminal running while you launch the UI in a separate termainal.

### About pipenv

Python tooling is controlled by `pipenv`, which is a wrapper around virtualenv. It confers a lot of the functionality found in more modern package control schemes such as npm and yarn for javascript.

To run a single command, use `pipenv run`. To install a python module, use `pipenv install my_package`. To "activate" the python environment for the project indefinitely, use `pipenv shell`, which is equivalent to `workon <env>` (virtualenvwrapper) or `source /bin/activate` (virtualenv).


# Building the UI layer

Open5e uses the Nuxt framework for Vue.js, which takes care of a lot of the architectural work for the frontend layer while allowing a large amount of flexibility.

## Build Setup

From /open5e

``` bash
cd ui
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev
```

Other build options:
```
# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
