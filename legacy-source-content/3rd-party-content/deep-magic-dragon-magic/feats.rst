Feats
-----

The depth and breadth of dragon magic gives
its practitioners unique talents and capabilities
unavailable to other wizards or sorcerers. Anyone
might be touched by dragon magic, however, and
these gifts are represented by the following feats.

.. _dm:dm:careful-dragon-mask:

Careful Dragon Mask
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Prerequisite: The ability to** :ref:`invoke a dragon mask <dm:dm:invoke-dragon-mask>`

You’ve mastered the ability to cast spells while
wearing your dragon mask. With this feat, you no
longer have disadvantage on attack rolls with spells
and cantrips, and the targets of your spells don’t have
advantage on saving throws, while you’re under the
effect of your dragon mask.

.. _dm:dm:dual-dragon-aspect:

Dual Dragon Aspect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Prerequisite: The ability to** :ref:`invoke dragon wings <dm:dm:invoke-dragon-wings>`

You’ve mastered the difficult ability to wear two
different dragon aspects at the same time. When you
switch from one aspect to another, the aspect you
remove lingers for 1 round, provided its maximum
duration hasn’t expired. During this 1 round of
overlap, both aspects are visible and you have full
access to the benefits and drawbacks of both aspects
simultaneously.

.. _dm:dm:fearsom-dragon-mask:

Fearsome Dragon Mask
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Prerequisite: The ability to** :ref:`invoke a dragon mask <dm:dm:invoke-dragon-mask>`

You can manipulate the visage of your dragon mask
to be a terrifying sight to your foes. Any target struck
by your mask’s bite attack must make a successful
Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or
be :ref:`srd:frightened` of you until the end of your next turn.
If you augmented the attack with a spell slot, the
frightened condition lasts an additional number of
rounds = the level of the expended spell slot.

.. _dm:dm:radiant-dragon-heart:

Radiant Dragon Heart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Prerequisite: The ability to** :ref:`invoke a dragon heart <dm:dm:invoke-dragon-heart>`

You can link radiant power to your dragon heart. In
addition to the damage type done by your dragon
heart’s breath attack, the damage is also considered
radiant. In addition, a creature that fails its saving
throw against the breath weapon is also :ref:`srd:blinded` until
the end of your next turn.

.. _dm:dm:find-the-titans-weakness:

Find the Titan's Weakness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can spot the weaknesses in a foe’s defenses. You
gain the following benefits.

* Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum
  of 20.
* As an action, you analyze the defenses of one Large
  or larger creature you can see. Your next attack
  against that creature is made with advantage, and
  the attack scores a critical hit on a natural roll of 18,
  19, or 20.

.. _dm:dm:fortifying-healer:

Fortifying Healer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell**

Your healing magic is augmented by the fortifying
magic of resolute bravery. If you target one or more
allies with a spell that allows them to regain hit points,
those allies are immune to being frightened for a
number of rounds = the level of the healing spell. In
addition, one ally who healed hit points (your choice)
gains inspiration. You must complete a short or long
rest before you can grant inspiration again.

.. _dm:dm:dragonsmith:

Dragonsmith
~~~~~~~~~~~

You have studied the craft of turning components
from a dragon’s body into weapons and armor.
Working in conjunction with a master weaponsmith
or armorsmith, you can create weapons and armor
from the teeth, bones, scales, hide, or other parts of
a dragon. The cost to create these items is ten times
the normal cost of the item. The number and type of
items that can be made from a particular dragon’s
corpse is up to the GM, but considering how much
violence must be inflicted on a dragon to bring it
down, the amount of salvageable raw matieral is low;
dragons don’t die from superficial damage.

Any type of melee weapon or bow can be made. The
resulting weapon, in the hands of a proficient wielder,
does an additional 1d6 damage of a type appropriate
to the dragon whose body was used to create the
weapon. For example, a blue dragon dagger does 1d4
piercing damage plus 1d6 lightning damage.

Any type of armor can be made except padded or
chain (shirt or mail). The resulting armor or shield, in
the panoply of a proficient user, provides resistance
to the damage type appropriate to the source dragon.
For example, black dragon scale mail gives its wearer
resistance to acid damage.

.. _dm:dm:dragonrider:

Dragonrider
~~~~~~~~~~~

**Prerequisite: Strength or Dexterity 15 or higher**

You have trained to climb atop an opponent much
larger than yourself, giving you an advantage
in combat against enormous foes. You gain the
following benefits.

* During your movement, you can try to enter the
  space of a creature at least two size categories larger
  than you. To do so, conduct a contest between
  your Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)
  opposed by the creature’s Dexterity (Acrobatics).
  If you win, you enter the creature’s space and are
  considered to be riding it. If you lose, you don’t
  enter the creature’s space and your movement ends.
* While you’re riding the creature, if it moves, you
  move with it. You also have advantage on your first
  melee attack against the creature on each of your
  turns.
* The creature’s attacks against a rider are made with
  disadvantage.
* The creature can dislodge you by using an action
  to conduct a contest between its Dexterity
  (Acrobatics) and your Dexterity (Acrobatics) or
  Strength (Athletics), whichever you prefer. If it wins
  the contest, you are flung off the creature and land
  on your feet, unharmed, in an adjacent space of
  your choice.

.. _dm:dm:unthreatening:

Unthreatening
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Prerequisite: Charisma 13 or higher**

You’re adept at making yourself seem to be less of a
threat than you actually are. You gain the following
benefits.

* Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum
  of 20.
* When a creature two or more size categories larger
  than you targets you with a melee weapon attack,
  you can use your reaction to make yourself seem
  pathetic and unthreatening. The creature must
  redirect its attack against a different target; if no
  alternative target is within the attacker’s reach or
  range, it can still attack you. Until the end of your
  next turn, your next melee or ranged attack against
  that creature is made with advantage. You must
  complete a short or long rest before using this
  ability again.
