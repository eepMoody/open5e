Arcane Tradition: Dragon Mage
-----------------------------

Wizards practice the subtle magic of pulling power
from thin air and shaping it to fit their needs.
Sorcerers tame the chaotic power within themselves,
releasing it in barely controlled gouts of magical
energy. Mages who walk the path between these two
sources of magic are called dragon magi, and they
meld the order of dweomery with the chaos of sorcery
to grant themselves power that either tradition could
never muster alone.

Dragon magi manifest their magic in many styles
as diverse as the draconic species and the types of
magic that populate the worlds. Kobolds serving as
councilors to great wyrms are taught by their masters
to harness their innate draconic natures through the
use of more traditional spells. A wild-eyed human,
oozing sorcerous magic from an ancient draconic
ancestor, might find a kindly wizard to help her focus
her power. Special legions of dragonborn troops train
with a master dragon mage, learning all there is to
know to better defend their homeland from invaders.

.. _dm:dm:invoke-dragon-mask:

Invoke Dragon Mask
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting at 2nd level, you can invoke a magical
dragon mask. The dragon mask is translucent
magical force in the form of a dragon’s head that
sits atop your shoulders and surrounds your head.
Your face is still visible beneath the mask, which
does not hinder your vision. To create the mask,
you take a bonus action and expend a spell slot. The
mask’s duration = (3 rounds × the level of the spell
slot expended). The dragon mask remains until its
duration ends, you become incapacitated, or you use
a bonus action to dismiss it or replace it with another
dragon aspect.

While you wear your dragon mask, you gain the
following benefits and drawbacks.

* You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your
  Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).
* You gain a bite attack. As an action, make a melee
  spell attack against an adjacent target. On a hit,
  the target takes (1d8 + your Int modifier) piercing
  damage. This counts as a magical attack for
  purposes of overcoming a target’s immunity or
  resistance to piercing damage.
* You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks
  and on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.
* You make ranged and melee spell attacks with
  disadvantage, and your targets have advantage on
  their saving throws against your spells.
* As a bonus action, you can expend an additional
  spell slot to augment your dragon mask. Your next
  bite attack is made with advantage and does an
  additional 1d8 piercing damage per level of the spell
  slot expended.

.. _dm:dm:invoke-dragon-heart:

Invoke Dragon Heart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting at 6th level, you can invoke a magical dragon
heart—a translucent magical force in the form of a
beating heart that covers your chest. To create the
dragon heart, you take a bonus action and expend
a spell slot. The dragon heart’s duration = (3 rounds
× the level of the spell slot expended). The dragon
heart remains until its duration ends, you become
incapacitated, or you use a bonus action to dismiss it
or replace it with another dragon aspect.
While you wear your dragon heart, you gain the
following benefits.

* You gain a bonus to Wisdom and Charisma
  saving throws equal to your Intelligence modifier
  (minimum of +1).
* You gain temporary hit points equal to twice your
  wizard level. Any remaining temporary hit points
  are lost when your dragon heart aspect ends.
* You gain a breath attack. As an action, you can
  exhale a line of energy 30 feet long and 5 feet wide.
  Each creature in the line must make a successful
  Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 damage. The
  damage type can be acid, cold, fire, or lightning. You
  choose the damage type the first time you make a
  breath attack with this dragon heart, and it can’t be
  changed until you manifest a new dragon heart.
* As a bonus action, you can spend an additional
  spell slot to augment your dragon heart. For each
  level of the expended spell slot, your next breath
  weapon attack becomes 10 feet longer and does an
  additional 2d6 damage.

.. _dm:dm:invoke-dragon-wings:

Invoke Dragon Wings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting at 10th level, you can invoke magical dragon
wings of translucent magical force. To create the
wings, you take a bonus action and expend a spell slot.
The dragon wings’ duration = (2 rounds × the level of
the spell slot expended). The dragon wings remain
until their duration ends, you become incapacitated,
or you use a bonus action to dismiss them or replace
them with another dragon aspect.

While you wear your dragon wings, you gain the
following benefits.

* Your speed increases by 10 feet, and you gain a fly
  speed equal to your walking speed.
* You gain resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning,
  piercing, and slashing damage.
* You have advantage on melee and ranged spell
  attack rolls.
* As a bonus action, you can spend an additional spell
  slot to augment your dragon wings. Until the start
  of your next turn, your fly speed increases by (5 feet
  × the level of the spell slot expended). Additionally,
  you can choose one creature per level of the
  expended spell slot; until the start of your next turn,
  ranged attacks against selected creatures are made
  with disadvantage, if the target is within 10 feet of
  you.

.. _dm:dm:invoke-dragon-tail:

Invoke Dragon Tail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting at 14th level, you can invoke a magical dragon
tail. You use a bonus action and spend a spell slot to
invoke the dragon tail, which lasts for 1 round per level
of the spent spell slot. The dragon tail remains as long
as you are not incapacitated, until the duration ends,
or until it is dismissed or replaced with a bonus action.
The dragon tail is a translucent magical force, in the
form of a 15-foot-long appendage capable of striking
with incredible force.

While you wear your dragon tail, you gain the
following benefits:

* You are immune to the grappled condition.
* You have proficiency on Strength and Dexterity
  saving throws, and on Strength checks. In addition,
  you can opt to use your Intelligence modifier
  instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier on
  those saving throws and skill checks.
* You gain a tail attack. As an action, make a separate
  melee spell attack against each target within 15 feet
  of you. Each target that’s hit takes (3d10 + your Int
  modifier) bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10
  feet away from you; it must also make a successful
  Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or
  be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. This attack is considered magical
  for purposes of overcoming a target’s immunity or
  resistance to bludgeoning damage.
* As a reaction, you can make a tail attack against a
  creature that approaches to within 15 feet of you.
* As a bonus action, you can expend an additional
  spell slot to augment your dragon tail. Until the
  start of your next turn, your dragon tail attack
  does additional damage = (1d10 × the level of the
  spell slot expended). In addition, you regain hit
  points = (3 × the level of the spell slot expended).
