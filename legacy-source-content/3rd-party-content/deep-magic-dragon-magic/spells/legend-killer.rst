**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a silver scroll describing the spell’s target worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tap into the life force of a creature that is capable
of performing legendary actions. When you cast the
spell, the target creature must make a successful
Constitution saving throw or lose the ability to take
legendary actions for the spell’s duration. A creature
can’t use legendary resistance to automatically
succeed on the saving throw against this spell. An

It continues repeating the saving throw until the spell
ends or it regains all its legendary actions.
