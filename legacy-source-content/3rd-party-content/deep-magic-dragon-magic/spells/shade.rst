2nd-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*bard, cleric, sorcerer, warlock, wizard*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a magical screen across your eyes. While
the screen remains, you are immune to blindness
caused by visible effects, such as color spray. The spell
doesn’t alleviate blindness that’s already been inflicted
on you. If you normally suffer penalties on attacks or
ability checks while in sunlight (such as those caused
by sunlight sensitivity), those penalties don’t apply
while you’re under the effect of this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration of the spell
increases by 10 minutes for each slot level above 2nd.
