Detect Dragons
--------------

2nd-level divination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*bard, druid, sorcerer, wizard*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You can detect the presence of dragons and other
draconic creatures within your line of sight and 120
feet, regardless of disguises, illusions, and alteration
magic such as polymorph. The information you uncover
depends on the number of consecutive rounds you
spend an action studying a subject or area. On the
first round of examination, you detect whether any
draconic creatures are present, but not their number,
location, identiy, or type. On the second round, you
learn the number of such creatures as well as the
general condition of the most powerful one. On the
third and subsequent rounds, you make a DC 15
Intelligence (Arcana) check; if it succeeds, you learn
the age, type, and location of one draconic creature.
Note that the spell provides no information on the
turn itâ€™s cast unless you have the means to take a
second action that turn.
