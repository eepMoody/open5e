Scale Rot
---------

4th-level necromancy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*bard, cleric, ranger, sorcerer, warlock, wizard*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of rotten meat)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You summon death and decay to plague your enemies.
One creature of your choosing within 30 feet of you
that has natural armor must make a Constitution
saving throw. If it fails, attacks against that creature’s
Armor Class are made with advantage, and the
creature can’t regain hit points through any means.
An effected creature can end the effect by using an
action to make a successful Constitution saving
throw. A successful saving throw ends the effect on
that creature and makes the creature immune to
further castings of *scale rot* for 24 hours.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the number of affected
targets increases by 1 per slot level above 4th.
