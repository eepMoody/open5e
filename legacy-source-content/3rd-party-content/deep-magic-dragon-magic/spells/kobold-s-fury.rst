Koboldâ€™s Fury
-------------

1st-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*bard, cleric, sorcerer, warlock, wizard*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a kobold scale)

**Duration:** 1 round

Your touch infuses the rage of a threatened kobold
into the target. The target has advantage on melee
weapon attacks until the end of its next turn. In
addition, its next successful melee weapon attack
against a creature larger than itself does an additional
2d8 damage.
