Catch the Breath
----------------

3rd-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*bard, cleric, warlock, wizard*

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You can cast this spell as a reaction when youâ€™re
targeted by a breath weapon. Doing so gives you
advantage on your saving throw against the breath
weapon. If your saving throw succeeds, you take
no damage from the attack even if a successful save
normally only halves the damage.

Whether your saving throw succeeded or failed,
you absorb and store energy from the attack. On your
next turn, you can make a ranged spell attack against
a target within 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes 3d10
force damage. If you opt not to make this attack, the
stored energy dissipates harmlessly.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage done by
your attack increases by 1d10 for each slot level above
3rd.
