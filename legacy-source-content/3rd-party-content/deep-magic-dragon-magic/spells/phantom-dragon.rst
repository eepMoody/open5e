Phantom Dragon
--------------

3rd-level illusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*druid, sorcerer, wizard*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of dragon egg shell)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You tap your dragon magic to make an ally appear as a
draconic beast. The target of the spell appears to be a
dragon of size Large or smaller. Upon first seeing this
illusion, observers make a Wisdom saving throw to
see through it.

You can use an action to make the illusionary
dragon seem ferocious. Choose one creature within
30 feet of the illusionary dragon to make a Wisdom
saving throw. If it fails, the creature is :ref:`srd:frightened` of
the “dragon.” The creature remains frightened until
is uses an action to make a successful Wisdom saving
throw or the spell’s duration expires.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, increase the number
of targets the illusion can frighten by 1 per slot level
above 3rd.
