Claws of the Earth Dragon
-------------------------

5th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*bard, cleric, sorcerer, wizard*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You summon the power of the earth dragon and
shoot a ray at one target within 60 feet. The target
falls :ref:`srd:prone` and takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage from
being slammed to the ground. If the target was flying
or levitating, it takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning
damage per 10 feet it falls. If the target makes a
successful Strength saving throw, damage is halved, it
doesn’t fall, and it isn’t knocked prone.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage done by
the attack increases by 1d8 and the range increases by
10 feet for each slot level above 5th.
