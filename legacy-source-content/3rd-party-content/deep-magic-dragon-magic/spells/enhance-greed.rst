2nd-level divination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*bard, cleric, sorcerer, warlock, wizard*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You detect precious metals, gems, and jewelry within
60 feet. You do not discern their exact location, only
their presence and direction. Their exact location is
revealed if you are within 10 feet of the spot.

*Enhance greed* penetrates barriers but is blocked by 1
foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of
lead, or 3 feet of dirt or wood.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration of the
spell increases by 10 minutes and another 30 feet can
be added to its range for each slot level above 2nd.
