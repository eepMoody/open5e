Dragon, Mithral
---------------

*Mithral dragons are wise and learned, and are legendary
peacemakers and spellcasters. They pursue their own interests
when not called to settle disputes.*

**Glimmering Champions.** Light glints off a mithral dragon’s
glossy scales, shining silver-white, and its tiny wings fold flush
against its body—but open like a fan to expose shimmering,
diaphanous membranes. Its narrow head, with bare slits for its
eyes and nostrils, ends in a slender neck. The dragon’s sleek look
continues into its body and a mithral dragon’s impossibly thin
frame makes it look extremely fragile.

**Rage in Youth.** Younger mithral dragons raid and pillage
as heavily as any chromatic dragon, driven largely by greed to
acquire a worthy hoard—though they are less likely to kill for
sport or out of cruelty. In adulthood and old age, however, they
are less concerned with material wealth and more inclined to
value friendship, knowledge, and a peaceful life spent in pursuit
of interesting goals.

**Peacemakers.** Adult and older mithral dragons are diplomats
and arbitrators by temperament (some dragons cynically
call them referees), enjoying bringing some peace to warring
factions. Among all dragons, their strict neutrality and ability to
ignore many attacks make them particularly well suited to these
vital roles.
