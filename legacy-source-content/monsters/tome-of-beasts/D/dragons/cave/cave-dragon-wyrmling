Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage.

**Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales a cone of
black poison gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area
must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6)
poison damage on a failed save and the target is poisoned if
it is a creature. The poisoned condition lasts until the target
takes a long or short rest or removes the condition with lesser
restoration. If the save is successful, the target takes half the
damage and does not become poisoned.
