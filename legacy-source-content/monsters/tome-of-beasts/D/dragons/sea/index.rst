Dragon, Sea
-----------

*This aquamarine dragon has a shark’s head that tapers off into a
sleek eel-like body. Its large fins double as wings.*

**Divine Dragons.** Sea dragons are the children of the ocean,
and believe they are semi-divine beings, worthy of worship.
Given their size and power, they may be right; certainly, they are
often companions or steeds to gods of the sea.

Despite the solemn duties the sea dragons invoke thanks
to their lineage, they are extremely whimsical. While these
immense creatures are playful, their games can shatter hulls and
drown sailors. The sea dragons course through the waves with
tangible joy as they hunt whales and entire schools of tuna.

**Shipwreck Art.** Sea dragons love collecting treasure,
especially prize the sunken treasure-filled hulls of ships lost to
storm, battle, or their own handiwork. While they appreciate all
wealth, they prefer hardy items that can stand up to long exposure
to sea water. Precious metals and gemstones add a dramatic luster
to the dragon’s lair when they catch stray beams of light. Sea
dragons take any more perishable treasures and place them on a
reef-altar, to dissolve in the sea as a tithe to the sea gods.

**Sunken Memorials.** A sea dragon’s lair is littered with
meticulously arranged ships consigned to the deeps. These
wrecks are often artfully smashed to allow the treasures in the
hold to spill out onto the sea floor. It may seem haphazard, but
it displays a complex aesthetic that only other sea dragons can
truly appreciate. Because they arrange these wrecks so carefully,
a dragon notices immediately if its hoard is disturbed.

Sea Dragon’s Lair
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sea dragons dwell in lairs dwell in lairs beneath the waves:
ocean fissures and caves, lightless trenches full of strange rock
formations, and sheltered reefs of cultivated coral.

Whatever the place, it’s dedicated to the worship of sea gods.
Despite the draconic instinct for seclusion and protection when
choosing a lair, sea dragons always choose lairs relatively close to
humanoid trade routes and abundant supplies of fish.

The sky surrounding a sea dragon’s lair is perpetually stormy,
and the seas run high. If a captain is courageous, these high winds
and swift-running currents can cut significant time off a voyage.

Lair Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a
lair action and generates one of the following effects. The dragon
can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

* Four vortexes, each 5 feet in diameter and up to 30 feet tall,
  appear within the lair where the dragon wishes. Creatures
  occupying the space where a vortex appears or who enter
  the vortex for the first time on a turn must make a DC 15
  Dexterity save or be :ref:`srd:restrained`. As an action, a creature can
  free itself or another creature from a vortex by succeeding on a
  DC 15 Strength check. The vortexes last until the dragon uses
  this lair action again or until the dragon dies.
* The dragon creates a wall of living coral on a solid surface it
  can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long,
  30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each
  creature within its area takes damage as if touching the wall
  and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space, on whichever side
  of the wall it wants. Touching the wall releases painful stings
  that deal 18 (4d8) poison damage, or half that with a successful
  DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of the
  wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to fire damage, and
  immunity to psychic damage. The wall lasts until the dragon
  uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.
* The dragon bends time around its enemies. Four creatures the
  dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15
  Wisdom save or be affected by a :ref:`srd:slow` spell. This effect last until
  initiative count 20 on the following round.

Regional Effects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The region containing a legendary sea dragon’s lair is warped by
the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following
effects:

* Sea life becomes richer within 6 miles of the lair. Schools
  of fish move into new waters, sharks become common, and
  whale migration paths shift to pass near the area.
* Water temperatures drop sharply within 6 miles of the lair.
  Creatures not accustomed to cold suffer exposure to extreme
  cold while swimming in this water.
* Storms and rough water are more common within 6 miles of
  the lair.

If the dragon dies, conditions of the sea surrounding the lair
return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.
