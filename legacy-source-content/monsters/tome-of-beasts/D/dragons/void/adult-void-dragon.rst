Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Aura of Madness. It then
makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.

**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

**Aura of Madness.** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is
within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed
on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for 1
minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each
of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature
fails the saving throw by 5 or more it is driven insane. An insane
creature is :ref:`srd:frightened` permanently, and behaves as if affected
by :ref:`srd:confusion` while it is frightened in this way. If a creature’s
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is
immune to the dragon’s Aura of Madness for the next 24 hours.

**Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon uses one of the
following breath weapons.

  **Gravitic Breath.** The dragon exhales a 60-foot cube of
  powerful localized gravity, originating from the dragon.
  Falling damage in the area increases to 1d10 per 10 feet
  fallen. When a creature starts its turn within the area or
  enters it for the first time in a turn, including when the
  dragon creates the field, must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving
  throw. On a failure the creature is :ref:`srd:restrained`. On a success
  the creature’s speed is halved as long as it remains in the
  field. A restrained creature repeats the saving throw at the
  end of its turn. The field persists until the dragon’s breath
  recharges, and it can’t use gravitic breath twice consecutively.

  **Stellar Flare Breath.** The dragon exhales star fire in a 60foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20
  Dexterity saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) fire damage and
  31 (9d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much
  damage on a successful one.

**Teleport.** The dragon magically teleports to any open space
within 100 feet.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Void Twist.** When the dragon is hit by a ranged attack it can
create a small rift in space to increase its AC by 5 against that
attack. If the attack misses because of this increase the dragon
can choose a creature within 30 feet to become the new target
for that attack. Use the original attack roll to determine if the
attack hits the new target.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used
at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The
dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Void Slip (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon twists the fabric of
space. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed
on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 12 (2d6 + 5)
bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can
then teleport to an unoccupied space within 40 feet.

**Void Cache (Costs 3 Actions).** The dragon can magically reach
into its treasure hoard and retrieve one item. If it is holding an
item, it can use this ability to deposit the item into its hoard.
