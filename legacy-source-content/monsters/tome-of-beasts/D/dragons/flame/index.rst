Dragon, Flame
-------------

*The dragon bears black scales, more charred than naturally colored.
Cracks between the scales glow a dull red, until the dragon rears
its head and roars. Red embers become bright orange flames as the
creature lights up from tail to maw.*

The flame dragons are capricious creatures, fascinated by dark
emotions and destructive passions. The dragons of eternal fire
are proud and jealous, quick to anger, and utterly unforgiving.
They bring complete and total ruin to entire civilizations for
trivial reasons, but their true motivation is the fun to be had.
These burning serpents treat rage, deceit, and despair as toys
for their amusement. “May you be the fire’s plaything” is a curse
often used by the foolish.

**Taunting Others.** The hot-blooded creatures tease their
victims like cats, seeing the world and all within it as their
rightful prey. Young flame dragons are less subtle than their
elders. Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or
ruin a beautiful face for pleasure—direct and evil. As the dragon
matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more
complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder,
and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate.
Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true
resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might
foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a
despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler’s
ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark
ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such
momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends.
Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish
the fires it started.

**Malevolent Purpose.** The results of these schemes are
secondary to the enjoyment they
derive from pursuing a
nebulous and everchanging goal. Some
spend centuries
torturing a family line for nothing more than
trespassing on the dragon’s land. Others plot
eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen
words into the most dire of insults. The
vengeance itself is not as important as having
an excuse to hate, plot, and ruin. Flame
dragons relish such opportunities for
revenge, seeing each as a delightful hobby. The
disruption of a game kindles a true and terrible
rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their
anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.

**Fond of Souvenirs.** Flame dragons are as materialistic and
territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual
obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard.
Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but
they always collect a memento for each victory, whether
petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while
another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When
not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy
contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of
their own majesty and genius.

Nothing is safe from a flame dragon’s endless scheming
and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant
reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would
be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon’s undivided
attention for generations. It would be wiser still to make certain
there is not a trace of involvement in a flame dragon’s death.
All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the
gravest insult.

Flame Dragon’s Lair
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flame dragons dwell in lairs where a burning fire is always
near: volcanoes, sulfur mines, caves full of geysers, and places
where the Elemental Plane of Fire touches the Material Plane.
Whatever the place, its purpose is always to serve as a showcase
of all the trophies the dragon has collected. Carefully arranged
and organized prizes decorate the walls, sometimes even
protected behind crystal walls. This display both feeds the
dragon's vanity and pride, and also serves as a lure to attract
adventurers, since flame dragons love to encourage the lowest
instincts in their prey.
Many of these lairs feature a huge, reflective surface. A flame
dragon likes nothing more than itself.

Lair Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a
lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t
use the same effect two rounds in a row.

* A cloud of smoke swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered
  on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud
  spreads around corners and the area is lightly obscured. Each
  creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
  saving throw or be :ref:`srd:blinded` for 1 minute. A blinded creature
  repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
  the effect on itself on a success.
* The ground erupts with volcanic force at a point the dragon
  can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature within 20 feet of the
  point must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw
  or be knocked :ref:`srd:prone` and trapped in the ground. A creature
  trapped in this way is :ref:`srd:restrained` and can’t stand up. A creature
  can end the restraint if it or another creature takes an action to
  make a successful DC 15 Strength check.
* A wall of fire rises up from the ground within 120 feet of the
  dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet
  thick, can take any shape the dragon wants, and blocks line of
  sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must
  make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the
  saving throw takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. Each creature that
  enters the wall for the first time each turn or ends its turn there
  takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. The wall is extinguished when the
  dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.

Regional Effects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The region containing a legendary flame dragon’s lair is warped
by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the
following effects:

* Arguments and misunderstandings erupt easily within 6 miles
  of the lair. Friendships are easily broken and criminal acts are
  common.
* Temperatures rise within 6 miles of the lair. Crops wither,
  producing famines.
* Sulfur geysers form in and around the dragon’s lair. Some of
  them erupt only once an hour, so they’re spotted only with a
  successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. A creature on
  top of an erupting geyser takes 21 (6d6) fire damage, or half
  damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

If the dragon dies, the arguments and misunderstandings
disappear immediately and the temperatures go back to normal
within 1d10 days. Any geysers remain where they are.
