Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then
makes one bite attack and two claw attacks.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.

**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that
is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed
on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for
1 minute. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect
ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful
Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales fire in a
90-foot cone. Each creature in that area takes 91 (26d6) fire
damage, or half damage with a successful DC 23 Dexterity
saving throw. Each creature in that area must also succeed
on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or go on a rampage for 1
minute. A rampaging creature must attack the nearest living
creature or smash some object smaller than itself if no creature
can be reached with a single move. A rampaging creature
repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
the effect on itself on a success.

**Shifting Flames.** The dragon magically polymorphs into a
creature that has immunity to fire damage and a size and
challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true
form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is
wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form
(the dragon’s choice). In a new form, the dragon retains its
alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies,
Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and
capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form,
except any class features or legendary actions of that form.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing
from the options below. Only one legendary action
option can be used at a time and only at the end
of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains
spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom
(Perception) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a
tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2
Actions).** The dragon
beats its wings. Each
creature within 15 feet of
the dragon must succeed
on a DC 21 Dexterity saving
throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6)
bludgeoning damage and be
knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. The dragon
can then fly up to half its flying speed.
