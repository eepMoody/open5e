**Innate Spellcasting.** The dragon’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following
spell, requiring no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:feather-fall`

**Fog Vision.** The dragon sees normally through light or heavy
obscurement caused by fog, mist, clouds, or high wind.

**Uncontrollable.** The dragon’s movement is never impeded by
difficult terrain, and its speed can’t be reduced by spells or
magical effects. It can’t be restrained (per the condition), and
it escapes automatically from any nonmagical restraints (such
as chains, entanglement, or grappling) by spending 5 feet
of movement. Being underwater imposes no penalty on its
movement or attacks.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite
and two with its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.

**Breath of Gales (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales a blast
of wind in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that cone takes 11
(2d10) bludgeoning damage and is pushed 25 feet away from
the dragon and knocked :ref:`srd:prone`; a successful DC 16 Strength
saving throw halves the damage and prevents being pushed
and knocked prone. Unprotected flames in the cone are
extinguished, and sheltered flames (such as those in lanterns)
have a 75 percent chance of being extinguished.
