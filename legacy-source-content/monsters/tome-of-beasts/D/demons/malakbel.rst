Malakbel
--------

*Within a blinding wave of heat and glare strides a long-limbed,
misshapen form. The creature scorches everything in its path
as it strides forward.*

What most people recall most vividly from an
encounter with a malakbel is the blinding light
and blistering heat surrounding them. Rippling
distortion obscures the creature’s body, which is
roughly the size and shape of an adult human.

**Demonic Messengers.** Malakbel demons are
contradictory creatures. They are both messengers and
destroyers who carry the words of demon lords or even
dark gods to the mortal realm. Paradoxically, once their
message is delivered, they often leave none of its
hearers alive to spread the tale.

**Where Virtue Cannot Look.** The malakbel is the
embodiment of all that is forbidden and destructive.
Despite its vital role as a messenger, its destructive
nature always comes to the fore. A malakbel descends
upon settlements and travelers with the merciless and
relentless onslaught of the raging sun, burning all it sees
to cinders before vanishing like heat shimmers at dusk.

**Blistering Radiance.** The malakbel generates a 30-foot-radius
aura of searing light and heat. A creature that starts its turn in
the aura, or who enters it for the first time on a turn, takes 11
(2d10) radiant damage. The area in the aura is brightly lit, and
it sheds dim light for another 30 feet. The aura dispels magical
darkness of 3rd level or lower where the areas overlap.

**Distortion.** Ranged attacks against the malakbel have
disadvantage.

**Magic Resistance.** The malakbel has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The malakbel makes two scorching blast attacks.

**Scorching Blast.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +9 to hit, range 120 ft.,
one target. *Hit:* 18 (3d8 + 5) fire damage.

**Searing Flare (Recharge 5-6).** The malakbel intensifies its
Blistering Radiance to withering levels. All creatures in the
malakbel’s aura take 31 (7d8) radiant damage and gain a level
of :ref:`srd:exhaustion`; a successful DC 16 Constitution saving throw
reduces damage by half and negates exhaustion.

**Teleport.** The malakbel magically teleports to an unoccupied
space it can see within 100 feet.
