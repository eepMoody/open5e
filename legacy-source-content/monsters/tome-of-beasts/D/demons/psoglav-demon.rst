Psoglav Demon
-------------

*An immense creature sniffs at the air. Most of its head is covered by
a helmet from which one baleful eye gazes out. Its muzzle fuses flesh
and machinery, and sharp metal teeth glint from under its lips.*

**Paid in Souls and Memories.** These demonic creations are
bred for protection, which they provide for a select few. The price
for their guardianship is always high, and never in coin. Their
Abyssal breeders demand everything from memories to souls in
exchange for their services.

**Fond of Trophies.** Psoglav demons carry recent kills along
with them as grisly toys, and often wear strings of scalps or ears
as trophies. They do not mind the stench, and they enjoy gnawing
bones as a pastime, the larger and more durable the better.
Psoglav demons suffer no ill effects from bright light, but they
far prefer dappled shadow or full darkness.

**Helmet Totems.** Speculation about what a psoglav keeps under
its helmet is rampant. Some believe they keep stolen shadows
and souls there, others that their helmets are part of a leash held
by their breeders—and if the helmet were ever removed, one
would not only see the demon’s brains, but also release it from
servitude to its demonic lord or summoner. Psoglav demons
without a helmet are rare but extremely dangerous.

**Magic Weapon.** The psoglav’s weapon attacks are magical.

**Shadow Door (4/Day).** The psoglav has the ability to travel

The magical transport must begin and end in an area with at
least some dim light. The shadow door can span a maximum
of 90 feet.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The psoglav demon makes three bite attacks.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 18 (2d12 + 5).

**Shadow Stealing Ray (Recharge 5-6).** The psoglav emits a
beam from its single eye. One target within 60 feet of the
psoglav is hit automatically by the ray. The target is knocked 20
feet back and must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw
or be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. The target’s shadow stays in the space
the target was originally in, and acts as an undead :ref:`srd:shadow`
under the command of the psoglav demon.

If the creature hit with the shadow stealing ray flees the
encounter, it is without a natural shadow for 1d12 days before
the undead shadow fades and the creature’s natural shadow
returns. The undead shadow steals the body of its creature of
origin if that creature is killed during the encounter; in that
case, the creature’s alignment shifts to evil and it falls under
the command of the psoglav. The original creature regains its
natural shadow immediately if the undead shadow is slain.

A creature can only have its shadow stolen by the shadow
stealing ray once per day, even if hit by the rays of two
different psoglav demons, but it can be knocked back by it
every time it is hit.
