Berstuc
-------

*Although slightly stooped, this male figure is muscular and broad-shouldered.
The creature’s head is lost in a riot of moss, and a thick
mustache and beard reach almost to its waist.*

The hulking, moss-haired berstuc looks sculpted out of a
primordial forest—and it stands over 12 feet tall and weighs 800
pounds. Despite its great stature, it seems strangely gentle, with
a serene, almost soothing presence. Nothing could be further
from the truth; the berstuc is a murderous demon that stalks
woodlands and jungles of the Material Plane.

**Poisoned Fruit.** Berstuc prowl forests in search of travelers
to torment. A berstuc demon poses as a benevolent, or at least
indifferent, wood spirit to gain the trust of mortals. It allows
itself to be persuaded to help lost travelers (reluctantly) or to lead
them to their destinations. Once it draws its unwitting prey deep
into the woods, it strikes.

**Verdant Nature.** The berstuc doesn’t require food or sleep.

**False Presence.** The berstuc counts as a fey for purposes of
spells and magical effects that detect otherworldly creatures.
Beasts and plants are comfortable around the berstuc and will
not attack it unless ordered to or provoked.

**Magic Resistance.** The berstuc has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Twisted Path.** The berstuc leaves no path through
natural terrain and can’t be tracked with skill checks or
other natural means. Creatures that travel with it can’t
retrace their own trails, and they become hopelessly
lost after 1 hour of travel. Creatures led astray by a
berstuc have disadvantage on attempts to discern their
location or to navigate for 24 hours.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The berstuc makes three slam attacks and
Absorbs once.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage and the target is
:ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 16).

**Absorb.** The berstuc draws a Medium or smaller creature it
has grappled into its body. An absorbed creature is no longer
grappled but is :ref:`srd:blinded` and :ref:`srd:restrained`, has total cover from
attacks and other effects from outside the berstuc, and takes
14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 27 (5d10) poison damage
at the start of each of the berstuc’s turns. The berstuc can hold
one absorbed creature at a time.
If the berstuc takes 20 damage or more on a single turn
from a creature inside it, the berstuc must succeed on a DC
17 Constitution saving throw or expel the absorbed creature,
which falls :ref:`srd:prone` within 5 feet of the berstuc. If the berstuc
dies, an absorbed creature is no longer restrained and can
escape from the corpse by
using 5 feet of movement,
exiting :ref:`srd:prone`.
