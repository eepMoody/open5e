Dogmole
-------

*This mole-like creature is the size of a large dog, with a thick,
barrel-shaped body as heavy as a full-grown dwarf. A ring of
tentacles sprouts above a mouth dominated by spade-like incisors.
It has no visible ears and only tiny, cataract-filled eyes, but
somehow it senses its environment nonetheless.*

**Domesticated by Dwarves.** Mountain dwarves have
domesticated many subterranean creatures, among them a breed
of giant talpidae commonly called dogmoles. Energetic and
obedient, dogmoles pull ore-trolleys through mines, sniff out
toxic gases and polluted waters, and help dig out trapped miners.

**Sense Cave-Ins.** Dogmoles are renowned for their ability to
detect imminent cave-ins and burrowing monsters, making
them welcome companions in the depths. Outside the mines,
dogmoles serve as pack animals, guard beasts, and bloodhounds.

**Derro Cruelty.** Derro also use dogmoles, but such
unfortunate creatures are scarred and brutalized, barely
controllable even by their handlers.

**Wormkiller Rage.** Wild dogmole packs are famed for their
battles against monsters in the dark caverns of the world. If
