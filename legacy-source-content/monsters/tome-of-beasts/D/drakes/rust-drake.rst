Rust Drake
----------

*A motionless rust drake is easily mistaken for a pile of scrap metal.*

**Shedding Rust.** Aside from fangs and claws like iron spikes,
this dragon-like creature seems to be nothing more than a
collection of rust. Each beating of its wings brings a shower of
flakes.

**Warped Metallics.** Many sages claim that rust dragons are
a perversion of nature’s order obtained either by the corruption
of a metallic dragon’s egg or the transformation of such a dragon
by way of a ritual. Others disagree and propose another theory
about a malady that affects the skin of young metallic dragons
and ferrous drakes alike. So far, no one has discovered the truth
about their origins.

**Filthy Scrap Metal Eaters.** These foul creatures feed on
rust and are known as disease carriers.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The drake makes one bite attack and one tail
swipe attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 18 (3d8 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed
on a DC 16 Constitution save or contract Rust Drake Lockjaw.

**Tail Swipe.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

**Vomits Scrap (Recharge 5-6).** A rust drake can vomit forth a
15-foot cone of rusted metal. Targets in the affected area take
55 (10d10) slashing damage, or half damage with a successful
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. In addition, affected creatures
must also make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw
or contract Rust Drake Tetanus.

**Rust Drake Lockjaw.** This disease manifests symptoms in
1d4 days, when the affected creature experiences painful
muscle spasms, particularly in the jaw. After each long rest,
the creature must repeat the saving throw. If it fails, the victim
takes 1d3 Dexterity damage and is :ref:`srd:paralyzed` for 24 hours; if
the saving throw succeeds, the creature takes no damage and
feels well enough to act normally for the day. This continues
until the creature dies from Dexterity loss, recovers naturally
by making successful saving throws after two consecutive long
rests, or is cured with :ref:`srd:lesser-restoration` or comparable magic.
After the disease ends, the victim recovers 1d3 lost Dexterity
with each long rest; :ref:`srd:greater-restoration` or comparable magic
can restore it all at once.
