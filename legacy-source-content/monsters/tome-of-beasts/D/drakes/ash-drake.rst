Ash Drake
---------

*A lean and dull-scaled ash drake often perches on a chimney as if
it just crawled out, its tail still hanging into the chimney as smoke
billows out.*

**Chimney Nesting.** Ash drakes clog chimney flues and delight
in dusting crowds with thick, choking ash and soot, while the
drakes laugh with sneering, wheezing tones. To placate the
creatures, owners of smelters and smithies leave large piles of
ash for the drakes to play in, with the hope they leave the shop
and its workers alone. Anyone hunting ash drakes finds them
very difficult to attack in their cramped lairs because the
creatures blend in with the surroundings. Ash drakes often
befriend kobolds, who have little trouble appeasing the beasts
and appreciate the added security they bring.

**Hunt Strays and Pets.** Ash drakes eat rats and stray
animals, although few can resist snatching an unattended,
possibly beloved pet. Contrary to popular opinion, this drake
doesn’t consume ash, but enjoys a pile of ash like a cat would
catnip, rolling around in it and becoming wild-eyed. Anyone
who disrupts such play becomes the target of the creature’s
intensely hot and sooty breath weapon.

While an ash drake is three feet long with a four-foot long
tail that seems to trail off into smoke, it weighs less than
one might expect—approximately ten lb. Every third winter,
when chimneys are active, a male drake leaves his lair to find
a mate. If the new couple roosts in a city or town, the nearby
streets know it, as the air becomes nearly unbreathable with
soot. The resulting eggs are left in a suitable chimney, and one
of the parents protects the young until they leave the nest at two
years of age.

**Volcanic Haunts.** Ash drakes outside a city live in or near
volcanic plateaus, and mutter about the lack of neighbors to
bully. In the wild, an ash drake may partner with a red dragon or
:ref:`flame dragon <tob:flame-dragons>`, since the dragon provides its lesser cousin with
plenty of ash.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The ash drake makes one bite attack and two claw
attacks.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage + 3 (1d6) fire damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage.

**Ash Cloud.** An ash drake can beat its wings and create a cloud
of ash that extends 10 feet in all directions, centered on
itself. This cloud provides half cover, though the ash drake
can see normally through its own cloud. Any creature that
enters or starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 14
Constitution saving throw or become :ref:`srd:blinded` for 1d6 rounds.

**Ash Breath (recharge 6).** An ash drake spews a 20-foot cone
of blistering hot, choking ash. Any targets in the path of this
spray takes 14 (4d6) fire damage and become :ref:`srd:poisoned` for
one minute; a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw reduces
damage by half and negates the poisoning. A poisoned
creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.
