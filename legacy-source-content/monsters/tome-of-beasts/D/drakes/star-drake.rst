Star Drake
----------

*Twinkling motes of light move around this draconic creature’s
body like stars, their reflections twinkling across its metallic scales.*

**Returned Travelers.** A drake’s curiosity sometimes drives
it to seek experiences beyond its plane, and it finds companions
with which it travels the multiverse. Such drakes return quite
clearly changed in appearance, demeanor, and ability. Regardless
of which type of drake embarked on the journey, the creature
always returns as a star drake.

**Mortal Protectors.** Star drakes consider themselves
protectors of the Material Plane. They view those from other
planes as meddlers in the affairs of humanoid races, regarding
fiends and celestials as equally threatening. Star drakes
might negotiate with, drive off, or destroy such meddlers.
Occasionally, they lead extraplanar incursions to make it clear
outsiders are unwelcome.

**Glimmering Lights.** A star drake differs in appearance from
dragons primarily by its mottled metallic scales and the nimbus
of tiny stars surrounding its body. A star drake measures 10 feet
long and weighs roughly 500 lb.

turn within 10 feet of the drake must make a successful DC
18 Constitution saving throw or become :ref:`srd:incapacitated`. At the
start of a character’s turn, a character can choose to avert its
eyes and gain immunity against this effect until the start of
its next turn, but it must treat the drake as :ref:`srd:invisible` while the
character’s eyes are averted.

spells, requiring no material components:

*Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage.

**Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6).** The drake exhales either fire

78 (12d12) fire or cold damage, whichever the drake wishes, or
half damage with a successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throw.

**Searing Star (1/Day).** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +12 to hit, range
120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 65 (10d12) force damage, and the

legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Bite Attack.** The drake makes one bite attack.

**Nova (Costs 2 Actions).** The drake momentarily doubles
the radius and intensity of its nimbus of stars. Every sighted
creature within 20 feet of the drake must make a successful
DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become :ref:`srd:blinded` until the
end of its next turn. Characters who are averting their eyes are
immune to the nova.

**Pale Sparks.** The drake casts :ref:`srd:faerie-fire` or :ref:`srd:moonbeam`.
