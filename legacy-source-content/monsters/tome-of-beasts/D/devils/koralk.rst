Koralk (Harvester Devil)
------------------------

The fiendish hulk bears features taken from a nightmare scorpion,
with three stinging tails and four limbs, and wields a massive
scythe.

**Shaped by Arch-Devil.** These fiendish scorpions sprang from
the dark imagination an arch-devil who
twisted them into being from the tormented forms of lemures
and demoted devils. The arch-devil shaped the koralk to
not only be annihilators in battle, but also to gather souls from
the fallen, bypassing the typical methods of collecting souls and
speeding up the influx to feed his ends.

**Transforming Poison.** Poison from any one of the koralk’s
three stingers liquefies the target’s insides in an agonizing
transformation. The stung creature swells as its organs, muscle,
and skeleton rapidly break down and reform. When the skin
casing pops, it releases a spray of gelatinous goo and reveals
the form of a lemure, the lowest form of devil. The new lemure
is subject to the will of more powerful devils, and its fate from
that moment on is the same as any lemure’s. Eventually it will
be remolded into a higher form of devil and become another
warrior in service to the arch-devils and Arbeyach. Astoundingly,
the koralk’s poison can even work this transformation on
demons, converting them to the lowest form of devil.

**Infernal Mounts.** A koralk is large and strong enough for
Medium-size devils to ride as a mount. They don’t like being
used this way, but being devils, they do what they’re told by their
betters or suffer the consequences.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The koralk can make three stinger attacks and two
scythe attacks. It can also make a bite attack if it has a target
grappled.

**Scythe.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 16 (2d12 + 3) slashing damage, OR a Medium‑sized or
smaller target can be grappled by the koralk’s smaller, vestigial
arms instead (no damage, escape DC 13).

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one grappled
target. *Hit:* 19 (3d10 + 3) piercing damage.

**Stinger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage and the target
must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or
become :ref:`srd:poisoned`. While poisoned this way, the target takes
10 (3d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns, from
liquefaction of its innards. A successful save renders the target
immune to the koralk’s poison for 24 hours. If a creature dies
while poisoned by a koralk, its body bursts open, spewing vile
liquid and a newly-formed lemure devil. The lemure is under
the command of any higher-order devil nearby. The poison can
be neutralized by lesser restoration, protection from poison, or
comparable magic. If the lemure is killed, the original creature
can be restored to life by resurrection or comparable magic.
