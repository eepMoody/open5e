Orobas Devil
-------------

*Tall and powerful, this creature resembles a strong man with
well‑chiseled muscles, save its equine head, flaring nostrils, and
hoofed feet.*

The orobas thrive in Hell, selling their knowledge to those who
have the coin (or other form of payment). The common phrase,
“never trust a gift horse,” stems from these corrupting devils.

**Horse-Headed but Wise.** When called to the mortal world,
they sometimes take the shape of a destrier. Orobas devils
prefer to take the horrific form of a horse-headed man. Sulfuric
smoke curls from their nostrils and their fingers sport ragged
claws. This beast‑like appearance belies their true strength; the
orobas possess an uncanny knowledge of the past, as well as of
things to come.

**Masters of Deceit.** When bargaining with an orobas, one
must speak truthfully—or possess an exceptionally quick tongue
and the most charming smile. Practitioners of the dark arts
know these devils as the Lords of Distortion, for their ability to
practice deceit. They prize reality-warping magic above all else,
and bribes of that sort can win concessions when making a pact.

**Surrounded by Lessers.** Orobas devils gather lesser devils
both as chattel and defense. Their analytical minds telepathically
confer the strengths and weaknesses of foes to their allies. With
surprising speed, the deceivers can assess a battlefield, weigh
outcomes, and redirect forces. Enemies of the orobas almost
never catch them off guard. They have frequent, clear visions of
their immediate future.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The orobas makes four attacks: one
with its bite, one with its claw, one with its flail,
and one with its stomp.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13
to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 18 (3d6 + 8) piercing
damage. The target
must succeed on a DC
18 Constitution saving
throw or become
:ref:`srd:poisoned`. While poisoned in
this way, the target can’t regain
hit points and it takes 14 (4d6)
poison damage at the start of
each of its turns. The poisoned
target can repeat the saving throw
at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.

**Flail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) acid
damage.

**Stomp.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage.
