Ink Devil
---------

*This small devil wears a small red hat. A wicked grin flashes black
teeth, and the creature nervously wrings its hands, baring long,
needle-like claws.*

Ink devils have small, pursed mouths and long, thin, bony
fingers. Their nails resemble quills. Their heads are often bald
or shaved in a monastic tonsure, and they have two small horns,
no larger than an acorn. Their skin tends toward walnut, indigo,
and black tones, though the eldest are as pale as parchment. They
often wear robes and carry scroll cases, and many consider the
Baron Totivillus the greatest of arch-devils.

**Cowards at Heart.** Ink devils are talkers and cowards. They
prefer chatting, whining, and pleading to any form of combat.
When they are forced to fight, they prefer to hide behind other
devils. They force lesser devils, like lemures, to fight for them
while they use teleportation, invisibility, and their ability to disrupt
the concentration of spellcasters to harry the opposition.

**False Gifts.** They often give strangers false gifts, like letters
of credit, charters, or scholarly papers inscribed with a glyph of
warding to start combat.

**Bibliophiles and Bookworms.** Ink devils live in libraries
and scriptoria in the hells and related planes. Their speed and
keen vision make them excellent accountants, record keepers,
translators, and note takers. They cannot be trusted, and they
delight in altering documents for their own amusement or in
their master’s service.

**At will:** :ref:`srd:detect-magic`, :ref:`srd:illusory-script`, :ref:`srd:invisibility`, :ref:`srd:teleport`
(self plus 50 lb. of objects only)

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., single target.
*Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., single target.
*Hit:* 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage.

**Disrupt Concentration.** Their sharp, shrill tongues and sharper
claws make ink devils more distracting than their own combat
prowess might indicate. As a bonus action, an ink devil can
force a single foe within 30 feet of the ink devil to make a
DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or lose concentration until the
beginning of the target’s next turn.

**Corrupt Scroll.** An ink devil can corrupt the magic within any
scroll by touch. Any such corrupted scroll requires a DC 13
Intelligence saving throw to use successfully. If the check fails,
the scroll’s spell affects the caster if it is an offensive spell, or it
affects the nearest devil if it is a beneficial spell.

**Devil’s Mark.** Ink devils can flick ink from their fingertips at
a single target within 15 feet of the devil. The target must
succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 13), or the affected
creature gains a devil’s mark—a black, red, or purple tattoo in
the shape of an archduke’s personal seal. All devils have advantage on spell attacks
made against the devil-marked creature, and the creature
has disadvantage on saving throws made against spells and
abilities used by devils. The mark can be removed only by a
remove curse spell or comparable magic. In addition, the mark
detects as faintly evil and often shifts its position on the body.
Paladins, witchfinders, and some clerics may consider such a
mark proof that a creature has made a pact with a devil.
