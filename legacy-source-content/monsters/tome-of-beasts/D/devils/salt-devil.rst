Salt Devil
----------

*“They led that caravan without mercy or
kindness. If you fell or stumbled, they struck you,
making your tongue feel as sand or your body
ache with pain, then laughed, telling you to get
up. And once we arrived, gods, they had us take
the tools from the dead, withered hands of the last
slaves, and start digging.” He took a drink from his
waterskin, as if just the memory made him thirsty.*

**Sparkly Crystals.** Salt devils have sharp,
crystalline teeth, sparkling skin studded with
fine salt crystals, and long claws that leave jagged,
burning wounds. They can also fight with saltencrusted blades seemingly forged from thin air.

**Servants of Mammon.** Salt devils claim to serve
Mammon, and they often ally with gnolls and slavers
with whom they seek out oases to use as ambush sites
or just to poison the water.

**Slavers and Corruptors.** Salt devils create slave markets
and salt mines, where they thrive on the misery of those
indentured into their service. They detest summoning peers
during combat because they hate being indebted to another
devil. They prefer to forge alliances with mortals when partners
are needed for an endeavor, and they are less grasping and
greedy than one might expect of Mammon’s servants, preferring
to encourage corruption in others.
