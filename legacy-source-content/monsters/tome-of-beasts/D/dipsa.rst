Dipsa
-----

*Except for a pair of tiny fangs, the entire body of this yellowish-green
worm looks like a ropy tangle of slime-covered tubes and
puddles of mucus.*

**Anesthetic Ooze.** Many jungle clans believe the dipsa is an
eyeless snake, but it is a tubular ooze with a lethal poisonous
bite. The dipsa’s venom has an anesthetic quality that allows the
ooze to cling to creatures and slowly turn their innards to jelly
without being noticed until the victim falls down dead. Once the
poison’s numbing property wears off, however, victims report an
agonizing sense of burning from the inside out.

**Tiny Fangs.** A dipsa’s undulating movement evokes that of a
snake as much as its serpentine form, but close examination
reveals that it has neither bones nor internal organs, only tiny
fangs of the same color and substance as the rest of its body. A
dipsa never exceeds 1 foot in length. Its coloration oscillates
between sickly hues of yellow or green.

**Gelatinous Eggs.** Dipsas are hermaphroditic. When two
dipsas breed, they leave behind about 100 gelatinous eggs in a
small puddle of highly acidic milt. A dozen become fertilized
and survive long enough to hatch, after which they immediately
devour the others.

**Amorphous.** The dipsa can move through a space as narrow as
1 inch wide without squeezing.

**Discreet Bite.** The bite of a dipsa is barely perceptible and the
wound is quickly anesthetized. A creature bitten must succeed
on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the attack or
any damage taken from it.

**Translucent.** The dipsa can take the Hide action as a bonus
action on each of its turns.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature
in the dipsa’s space. *Hit:* 1 piercing damage, and the dipsa
attaches to the target. A creature with a dipsa attached takes
3 (1d6) acid damage per round per dipsa, and it must make
a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or have its hit
point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage
taken. If a creature’s hit point maximum is reduced to 0 by this
effect, the creature dies. This reduction to a creature’s hit point
maximum lasts until it is affected by a :ref:`srd:lesser-restoration` spell or
comparable magic.
