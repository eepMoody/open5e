**Frenzied Rage.** On its next turn after a deep one archimandrite
takes 10 or more damage from a single attack, it has
advantage on its attacks, it adds +4 to damage, and it can
make one extra unholy trident attack.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The deep one archimandriteâ€™s innate
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with
spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring
no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:bless`, :ref:`srd:revivify`, :ref:`srd:sacred-flame`, :ref:`srd:shocking-grasp`, :ref:`srd:suggestion`

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:charm-person`, :ref:`srd:lightning-bolt`, :ref:`srd:sanctuary`, :ref:`srd:shatter`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:chain-lightning`, :ref:`srd:cone-of-cold`, :ref:`srd:ice-storm`

**Legendary Resistance (1/Day).** If the deep one archimandrite
fails a saving throw, it can count it as a success instead.

**Lightless Depths.** A deep one hybrid priest is immune to the
pressure effects of the deep ocean.

**Voice of the Archimandrite.** With a ringing shout, the deep
one archimandrite summons all deep ones within a mile to
come to his aid. This is not a spell but a command that ocean
creatures and deep ones heed willingly.
