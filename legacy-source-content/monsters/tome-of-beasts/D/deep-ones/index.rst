Deep Ones
---------

*With enormous eyes, a wide mouth, and almost no chin, the deep
ones are hideous, fishlike folk, often hunched and scaled when
encountered in coastal villages.*

**Elder Gods.** In their fully grown form, the deep ones are an
ocean-dwelling race that worships elder gods such as Father
Dagon and Mother Hydra, and they dwell in deep water
darkness. Theyâ€™ve intermarried with coastal humans to create
human-deep one hybrids.

**Coastal Raiders.** The deep ones keep to themselves in
isolated coastal villages and settlements in the ocean for long
periods, and then turn suddenly, at the command of their patron
gods, into strong, relentless raiders, seizing territory, slaves, and
wealth all along the coasts. Some deep ones have even founded
small kingdoms lasting generations in backwater reaches or
distant chilled seas.

**Demand Sacrifices.** They demand tolls from mariners
frequently; those who do not leave tribute to them at certain
islands or along certain straits find the fish escape their nets,
or the storms shatter their hulls and drown their sailors. Over
time, some seafaring nations have found it more profitable to
ally themselves with the deep ones; this is the first step in their
patient plans to dominate and rule.
