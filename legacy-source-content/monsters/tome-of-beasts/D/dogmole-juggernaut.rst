Dogmole Juggernaut
------------------

*Hide armor and scraps of mail are nailed onto this scarred and
tattooed mole-like beast. A ring of tentacles sprouts above its
mouth, which is dominated by spade-like incisors. The beast has no
visible ears and only tiny, cataract-filled eyes. Blood and foam fleck
from its tentacled maw.*

**Grown from Chaos.** What the derro have done with certain
breeds of dogmole almost defies description, but the secret of
their size is a steady diet of chaos fodder, magical foodstuffs
and spells that force the creatures to grow and grow.

**Scarred and Abused.** Brutalized from birth and
hardened by scarification, foul drugs, and
warping magic, the dogmole juggernaut is
barely recognizable as a relative of its smaller
kin. A furless mass of muscle, scar tissue,
and barbed piercings clad in haphazard
barding, a dogmole juggernaut stands
seven feet tall at the shoulder and stretches
nine to twelve feet long. Its incisors are the
length of shortswords.

**Living Siege Engines.** Derro use dogmole
juggernauts as mounts and improvised siege
engines, smashing through bulwarks
and breaking up dwarven
battle lines. When not at
war, derro enjoy pitting
rabid juggernauts against
one another in frenzied
gladiatorial contests.

**Burrow.** Dogmole juggernauts cannot burrow into solid rock,
but they can move through softer material like soil or loose
rubble, leaving a usable tunnel 10 ft. in diameter.

**Ferocity (1/Day).** When the dogmole juggernaut is reduced to
0 hit points, it doesn’t die until the end of its next turn.

**Powerful Build.** A dogmole juggernaut is treated as one
size larger if doing so is advantageous to it (such as during
grapple checks, pushing attempts, and tripping attempts, but
not for the purposes of squeezing or AC). It gains advantage
against magical pushing attempts such as gust of wind or
Repelling Blast.

**Wormkiller Rage.** Wild dogmole juggernaut packs are famed
for their battles against the monsters of the dark caverns of the
world. If a dogmole juggernaut draws blood against vermin,
purple worms, or other underground invertebrate, it gains a +4
bonus to Strength and Constitution but suffers a -2 penalty to
AC. The wormkiller rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to
1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). It cannot end
the rage voluntarily while the creatures that sent it into a rage
still live.
