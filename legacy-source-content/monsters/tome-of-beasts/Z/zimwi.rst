Zimwi
-----

*This swift-moving, lanky humanoid has
long arms ending in wicked claws and jaws
that open impossibly wide.*

**Swift as Horses.** Distantly
related to the trolls, the swift and
nimble zimwi are a plague upon
southern lands. Constantly
hungry and ill-tempered, with
the speed to run down horses,
lone zimwi have been known to
attack large caravans.

**Always Starving.** Most of their attacks
are driven by hunger. The stomach of a
zimwi is larger than its body, extending
extra-dimensionally and driving the
zimwi nearly insane with the constant
sensation of emptiness, as though
it is starving to death. Because of
their endless hunger and low
intelligence, zimwi have little
awareness of the course of a
battle. Losing means only that they
have not eaten. As long as they continue
to feast, they fight on, feeling victorious until
death comes to them or all of their prey.

**Stomachs of Holding.** The mage-crafters
discovered the secret to turning zimwi
stomachs into extradimensional
containers similar to bags of holding.
Using a zimwi stomach in the creation
of such items reduces the cost of
materials by half.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack:** The zimwi makes one claws attack and one bite
attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium
or smaller creature grappled by the zimwi, that creature
is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the
creature is :ref:`srd:blinded` and :ref:`srd:restrained`, it has total cover against
attacks and other effects outside the zimwi, and it takes 14
(4d6) acid damage at the start of each of the zimwi’s turns.
If the zimwi’s stomach takes 20 damage or more on a single
turn from a creature inside it, the zimwi must succeed on a
DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or
regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall :ref:`srd:prone` in a space
within 5 feet of the zimwi. Damage done to a zimwi’s stomach
does not harm the zimwi. The zimwi’s stomach is larger on the
inside than the outside. It can have two Medium creatures or
four Small or smaller creatures swallowed at one time. If the
zimwi dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it
and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement,
exiting :ref:`srd:prone`.

**Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage, and if the target
is a Medium or smaller creature and the zimwi isn’t already
grappling a creature, it is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 11).
