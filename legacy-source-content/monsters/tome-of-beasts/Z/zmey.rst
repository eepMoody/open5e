Zmey
----

*Crashing through the forest, this three-headed dragon stands
upright, its spiked tail thrashing from side to side as it walks. A
vicious mouth lined with glistening teeth graces each head, and its
green scales gleam in the fleeting sunlight.*

Hunting beneath the canopy of the forest, lurking below the
surfaces of lakes, and guarding caves concealing great treasure
and mystery, the zmey has two roles—vicious terror and
nature’s protector.

**Claws of the Forest.** Single-mindedly destructive, the zmey
keeps the heart of the forest free from interlopers. Rumors
suggest the heart of an ancient forest itself can control the
actions of these beasts, while others believe that they have a pact
with certain forest druids. Certainly they are clever enough,
often destroying bridges, dams, or logging camps infringing on
their territory.

**Solitary Hunters.** Zmey avoid their own kind, seeking
out isolated hunting grounds. They eat any organic matter,
but they favor the fresh meat of large birds and mammals. The
smarter the prey, the better, because zmey believe that intellect
flavors the meat. They consider alseids, halflings, and gnomes
especially succulent.

**Three-Headed Rage.** Dappled black and green scales cover
this enormous beast and its three towering necks are long and
powerful. Each neck is topped with an identical, menacing head,
and each head is flanked by spiny, frilled membranes. A forked
tongue flickers across long pale teeth, and six pairs of eyes burn
red with rage.

When a zmey stands upright, it measures 25 feet from snout to
tail. The beast weighs over 9,000 lb.

**Languages** Common, Draconic, Elvish, Sylvan

**Challenge** 14 (11,500 XP)

**Amphibious.** The zmey can breathe air and water.

**Lake Leap.** A zmey spends much of its time lurking in lakes and
ponds. When submerged in a natural pool of standing water,
it can transport itself as a bonus action to a similar body of
water within 5,000 feet. Rapidly flowing water doesn’t serve for
this ability, but the zmey can leap to or from a river or stream
where the water is calm and slow-moving.

**Legendary Resistance (1/Day).** If the zmey fails a saving throw,
it can count it as a success instead.

**Multiheaded.** The zmey normally has three heads. While it
has more than one head, the zmey has advantage on saving
throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened,
and stunned. If the zmey takes 40 or more damage in a single
turn (and the damage isn’t poison or psychic), one of its heads
is severed. If all three of its heads are severed, the zmey dies.

**Regeneration.** The zmey regains 15 hit points at the start of its
turn. If the zmey takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn’t
function at the start of the zmey’s next turn. Regeneration
stops functioning when all heads are severed. It takes 24 hours
for a zmey to regrow a functional head.

**Spawn Headling.** The severed head of a zmey grows into a
:ref:`tob:zmey-headling` 2d6 rounds after being separated from the
body. Smearing at least a pound of salt on the severed head’s
stump prevents this transformation.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The zmey makes one bite attack per head and one
claws attack.

**Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The zmey breathes up to three
60-foot cones of fire, one from each of its heads. Creatures
in a cone take 16 (3d10) fire damage, or half damage with a

damage adds together but each target makes only one saving
throw. A zmey can choose whether this attack harms plants or
plant creatures.
