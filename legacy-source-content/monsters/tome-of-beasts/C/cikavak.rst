Cikavak
-------

*The cikavak is a remarkably ugly magical bird—a supernatural
creature conjured through a lengthy ritual. A dark gray comb flops
atop their heads and shapeless wattles dangle from their throats.
They seem unimposing.*

**Dagger Beaks.** Cikavaks use their elongated, dull-gray beaks
to draw up nectar and other fluids—or to stab with the force
of a dagger. Although it requires great effort to call up these
homely birds, the magic is surprisingly common, known among
peasants and townsfolk as well as mages. Once summoned, they
remain faithful to their masters until death. While cikavaks don’t
speak, they comprehend the Common tongue and can speak
with animals to help their master. They often magically silence
the cries of more melodious birds.

**Potion Pouches.** Cikavaks possess another odd ability: when
fully distended, their ventral pouches hold up to half a gallon
of almost any liquid. These resilient pouches take little or no
damage from their contents, holding potions without ingesting
them or even carrying acid without injury.

Thieves make use of this ability, directing the birds to siphon
up liquids and thus steal honey from neighbors’ beehives, as
well as milk, beer, and wine. The most audacious thieves send
their birds into magicians’ towers, alchemists’ shops, or the
local apothecary to seize mercury, phlogiston, and more exotic
substances. They carry these stolen fluids back to their owner in
their pouches. While normally strong flyers, when laden with
liquids, their flight is clumsy at best.

**Folk Conjuration.** To call a cikavak with folk magic rituals,
a character must gather an egg from a black hen as well as
30 gp worth of herbs and colored chalks. Cast at sunset, the
folk ritual requires half an hour and requires a successful
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to succeed. (The material
components can be used multiple times, until the ritual
succeeds). The hen’s egg must then be carried and kept warm
for 40 days. During this time, the ritual caster must not bathe
or be subject to any spell effects. Usable only by non-casters,
the ritual’s feeble magic is immediately dispelled if the cikavak’s
master uses any other sort of spell or spell-like ability.
