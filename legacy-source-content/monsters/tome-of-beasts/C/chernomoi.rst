Chernomoi
---------

*These scaly creatures resemble
nothing so much as tiny,
batwinged dragonkin.*

**Dragon Sprites.** Chernomoi
(which means “lair sprite” in
Draconic) often reside discreetly in a
dragon lair or dragonborn household,
cleaning and tidying up at night, and
only occasionally keeping a small trinket
or shiny gemstone as compensation. They
appear as tiny, winged dragonkin, dressed
in metallic armor made of small coins and
semi-precious stones.

**Lair Alarms.** Chernomoi
are terrified of wyverns and
never lair anywhere near
them. Otherwise, they are
very protective of their
draconic masters and raise
an alarm if an intruder is
undetected. They fight with their
tiny blades and Shriek attack if
cornered, though they always flee from
danger as a first option— usually straight
to a dragon, dragonborn, or drake ally.
