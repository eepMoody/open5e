Clockwork Beetle
----------------

*Gleaming metal and whirring gears make up the form of this
elaborate mechanical insect the size of a housecat.*

**Bejeweled Familiars.** Forged by talented jewelers and sold
to gear-mages and aristocrats, clockwork beetles are highly
prized as familiars. Although normally created in the form
of metal beetles, their appearance can vary greatly. Some
resemble incandescent ladybugs while others have razor-sharp
horns reminiscent of deadly stag beetles. Some are
fashioned as darkling beetles with prehensile antennae,
and even weevil-like designs have been spotted.

**Flying Noisemakers.** In the
southern deserts, scarab beetle
patterns are particularly prized.
Anytime the creatures move they
emit an audible rhythmic buzz,
especially when taking to the air. Once
in flight, they create a disturbing
cacophony of clicks and whirs.

**Hidden Timers.** The
most talented gear‑mages
occasionally design a
clockwork beetle with
a hidden countdown
clock that silently
ticks down over years
or even decades.
When the tightly
wound gear-counter
expires, it suddenly
triggers a mechanical
metamorphosis within
the beetle, causing it to
rapidly transform and
blossom into a completely different clockwork creature—a
wondrous surprise known in advance only to the designer who
created it so many years ago.

**Constructed Nature.** A clockwork beetle doesn’t require
air, food, drink, or sleep.
