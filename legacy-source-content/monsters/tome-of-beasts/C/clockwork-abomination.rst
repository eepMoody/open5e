Clockwork Abomination
---------------------

*At rest, a clockwork abomination resembles a pile of debris and
scrap on the ground, but in motion it reveals a large insectoid
form with smoke rising between the plates of its hide. Its many
orange‑yellow eyes shine like dim lanterns and reveal no hint of
expression or intent.*

**Bound Devils.** Clockwork abominations result from
ill‑considered attempts to bind lesser devils into clockwork
or steam-driven constructs. The disciplines of devil binding
and engineering seemingly do not mix well, and the results
of such attempts are typically disastrous. Every now and
then, however, something goes right, and a clockwork
abomination is created.

**Junk Collectors.** Clockwork abominations are canny
enough to collect bits of old wagons, tools, or machinery
as camouflage. Motionless among such objects, they
can often surprise a foe.

**Sadistic Machines.** Malevolent in the extreme,
these fiendish automatons are frustrated by the
limits of their new forms, and they delight in
inflicting suffering on others. Constantly seeking
to break free of their creators’ control, the most
they can be entrusted to do is to serve as a guardian or
attack something.

**Constructed Nature.** A clockwork abomination doesn’t
require air, food, drink, or sleep.
