Clockwork Beetle Swarm
----------------------

*Light glints off the moving parts of almost a thousand clockwork
beetles in a biting cloud.*

**Freed But Foolish.** Clockwork beetle swarms form when
several of the creatures break free of their creators and bond
together in a noisy mass of clattering mechanical parts. Severed
from the bond of their creators, the beetle swarm lacks the
telepathy of singular clockwork beetles and has a reduced
mental capacity.
