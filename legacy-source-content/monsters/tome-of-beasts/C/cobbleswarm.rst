Cobbleswarm
-----------

*The paving stones underfoot suddenly lurch and tumble over one
another. Thousands of tiny limbs, pincers, and stingers break from
the stony surface and frantically scuttle forward.*

A cobbleswarm is made up of tiny, crablike creatures with
smooth, stony shells. Individually they are referred to as cobbles.
The creatures vary in size, shape, and color, but all have six
segmented legs, a whiplike stinger, and a single eye.

**Paving Stone Mimics.** When the eye is closed and the limbs
are pulled under the shell, cobbles are nearly indistinguishable
from lifeless paving stones. Victims of cobbleswarms are caught
unaware when the floor beneath them suddenly writhes and
shifts, and dozens of eyes appear where there should be none.

**Trap Affinity.** Cobbleswarms have a rudimentary
understanding of traps. They often hide in places where their shift
and tumble ability can slide intruders into pits or across trapped
areas, and kobold tribes prize them highly for this reason.

**False Appearance.** While the swarm remains motionless, it is
indistinguishable from normal stones.

**Shift and Tumble.** As a bonus action, the swarm can push a
prone creature whose space it occupies 5 feet.

**Shifting Floor.** Whenever the swarm moves into a creature’s
space or starts its turn in another creature’s space, that other
creature must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw
or fall :ref:`srd:prone`. A prone creature must make a successful DC 13
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to stand up in a space occupied
by the swarm.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and
vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening
large enough for a Tiny stone. The swarm can’t regain hit
points or gain temporary hit points.
