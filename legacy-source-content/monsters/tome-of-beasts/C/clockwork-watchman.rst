Clockwork Watchman
------------------

*This mechanical being’s body is composed of brass and iron and
bedecked in a loose uniform of the city watch. Its movements are
slow but steady.*

**Lightly Armored Servants.** Clockwork watchmen are
more solidly built versions of the more common clockwork
scullions (servant creatures in wealthy households, incapable of
combat). Proper clockwork watchmen are built with iron parts
instead of tin, and given keener senses. Many have small bits of
armor covering their joints and most vital parts.

**Constant Rounds.** They endlessly patrol the city day and
night, pausing only to receive maintenance and new boots.
Shouts & Stutters. Their speech is slow and halting, but their
distinctive shouts and whistles bring human guards at a run.

**Constructed Nature.** A clockwork watchman doesn’t
require air, food, drink, or sleep.

watchman’s chest. A creature can free itself (or another
creature) from the net by using its action to make a successful
DC 10 Strength check or by dealing 5 slashing damage to the
net at AC 10. The watchman can fire up to four nets before it
must be reloaded.
