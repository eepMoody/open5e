Urochar (Strangling Watcher)
----------------------------

*This horrible gigantic crimson leech slithers upright on four
muscular tentacles, each 30 feet long. At the top of its writhing
trunk, a great lidless eye glows with baleful orange light,
surrounded by quivering, feathered antennae fully 5 feet long.*

**Underworld Wanderers.** The urochar are among the most
dreaded monsters of the underworld. They have long plagued
the drow, morlocks, and other humanoid races of the deep paths.
They seek out death and the dying all the way to the banks of the
River Styx.

**Devour the Dying.** Urochars feast on the final moments of
those caught in their crushing tentacles. Though they rival the
terrible neothelids in power, urochars are quite passive, watching
the life and death struggles of other creatures and taking action
only to drink in a dying being’s final moments from a nearby
crevice or overhang, and taste their final gasps of horror.

**Immortal.** Strangling watchers are effectively immortal.
Gargantuan specimens in the deepest reaches of the underworld
are several millennia old.

**Death Throes.** When a strangling watcher dies, it releases all
the fear it consumed in its lifetime in a single, soul-rending
wave. All creatures within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC
19 Charisma saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened`. A frightened
creature takes 13 (2d12) psychic damage at the start of each of
its turns from the centuries of accumulated dread. It can repeat
the Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on a success.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The watcher’s innate spellcasting ability
is Charisma (spell save DC 19). It can cast the following spells,
requiring no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:feather-fall`

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:blur`, :ref:`srd:meld-into-stone`, :ref:`srd:phantasmal-killer`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:black-tentacles`, :ref:`srd:eyebite`, :ref:`srd:greater-invisibility`

**Spider Climb.** The watcher can climb any surface, including
upside down on ceilings, without making an ability check.

**Squeeze.** Despite their size, strangling watchers have slender,
boneless bodies, enabling them to squeeze through passages
only a Small-sized creature could fit through, without affecting
their movement or combat capabilities.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The watcher makes four attacks with its tentacles.

**Tentacle.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 20 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and the target
is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target
is :ref:`srd:restrained`. Each of its four tentacles can grapple one target.

**Paralyzing Gaze (Recharge 5–6).** The watcher can target
one creature within 60 feet with its eerie gaze. The target
must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become
:ref:`srd:paralyzed` for 1 minute. The paralyzed target can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
on a success. If a target’s saving throw is successful or the
effect ends for it, the target is immune to the watcher’s gaze
for the next 24 hours.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The urochar can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature’s turn. The strangling watcher
regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Crush Attack.** The urochar crushes one creature grappled by its
tentacle. The target takes 25 (4d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

**Tentacle Attack.** The watcher makes one tentacle attack.

**Tentacle Leap (Costs 2 Actions).**
Using a tentacle, the urochar
moves up to 20 feet to an
unoccupied space adjacent
to a wall, ceiling, floor,
or other solid surface.
This move doesn’t trigger
reactions. The urochar must
have at least one tentacle free
(not grappling a creature) to
use this action. Grappled
creatures move with the
urochar.
