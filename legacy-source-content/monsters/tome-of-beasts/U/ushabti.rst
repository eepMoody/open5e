Ushabti
-------

*The eye sockets in a large, ornate death mask suddenly ignite with a
golden radiance. With the creak of long-unused limbs, this towering
figure in ancient armor raises a khopesh and scepter once more.*

**Tomb Servants.** Ushabtis were placed in ancient tombs as
servants for the tomb’s chief occupants in the afterlife. They
are long-lasting constructs that can tend to physical work and
maintenance inside sealed tombs where flesh-and-blood laborers
couldn’t survive.

**Slaughter Tomb Robbers.** Ushabtis are most commonly
encountered in their roles as guardians—a function they fulfill
very effectively. An ushabti is sometimes obvious from the blood
of its victims, staining its form. Some tombs are littered with
bones of tomb robbers an ushabti has dispatched.
Khopesh and Scepter. Most ushabtis have human faces
and proportions, with features resembling a death mask. When
at rest, they stand or lie with arms folded across their chests,
clutching their scepter and khopesh. Many variations have been
found, however, including some that are completely inhuman,
animal‑headed, or that have abstract or fanciful designs such as a
sun sphere head or a body made entirely of papyrus scrolls

**Constructed Nature.** An ushabti doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

**Dynastic Aura.** A creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of
the ushabti must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw,
unless the ushabti is incapacitated. On a failed save, the
creature has its breath stolen; it takes 9 (2d8) necrotic damage,
and until the end of the ushabti’s next turn, can’t cast spells
that require a verbal component or speak louder than a
whisper. If a creature’s saving throw is successful, the creature
is immune to this ushabti’s Dynastic Aura for the next 24 hours.

**Healing Leech.** If a creature within 30 feet of the ushabti
regains hit points from a spell or a magical effect, the creature
gains only half the normal number of hit points and the
ushabti gains the other half.

**Immutable Form.** The ushabti is immune to any spell or effect
that would alter its form.

**Magic Resistance.** The ushabti has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The ushabti’s weapon attacks are magical.
