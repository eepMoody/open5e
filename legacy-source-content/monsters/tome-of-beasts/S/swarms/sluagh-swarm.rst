Sluagh Swarm
------------

*Some say the sluagh are fey turned by vampires, while others say
they are the evil souls of violent men, who cannot rest and return to
kill. Still others claim they are the souls of devilbound gnomes who
committed suicide. All agree that they are loathsome by nature.*

**Cowards Alone.** These tiny, malevolent fey dwell in darkness.
Alone they are cowards, but they are rarely encountered alone.
They are most active during the winter, especially during
winter’s long nights. They usually speak to their victims as they
attack, but those shouts are little more than whispers to the ears
of their prey.

**Chilling Touch.** Sluagh feed by using their chilling touch.
They devour small animals if nothing more appetizing is
available. Their victims are easy to identify; their skin is
unnaturally cold, and their features are frozen in fear.
Swarms of sluagh serve hags, devils, trollkin, and evil fey who
know the blood rituals to summon and direct them. Shadow
fey and drow send them against other elves, often targeting the
defenders of elven settlements, or their spouses and children.

**Legless Flocks.** Sluagh are tiny, gaunt humanoid creatures
the size of a weasel. They have no legs; instead their torso tapers
off in a disquieting way. Though they can fly, they can also pull
themselves quickly across the ground with their arms. They are
always draped in black, though their actual skin and hair are
pale white. They have sharp claws and fangs, and their eyes are
entirely black. In masses, they somewhat resemble a flock of
strange birds.

large enough for a Tiny fey. The swarm can’t regain hit points
or gain temporary hit points.

swarm can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

**Sunlight Weakness.** While in sunlight, the sluagh swarm has
disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Chilling Touch.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 0 ft.,
one creature in the swarm’s space. *Hit:* 28 (8d6) cold damage
or 14 (4d6) cold damage if the swarm has half of its hit
points or fewer. The target must make a successful DC 13
Constitution saving throw or be unable to regain hit points.
An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of
its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save. The
effect can also be ended with a :ref:`srd:greater-restoration` spell or
comparable magic.
