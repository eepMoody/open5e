Wolf Spirit Swarm
-----------------

*A pack of ghostly wolves appears in a swirl of greenish fog, seeming
to coalesce from the fog itself.*

When a pack of wolves dies of hunger or chill in the deep winter,
sometimes the pack leader’s rage at a cruel death—or the
summoning call of a necromancer—brings the entire pack back
to the mortal world as a slavering pack of greenish, translucent
apparitions that glides swiftly over snow and ice, or even rivers
and lakes.

**Dozen-Eyed Hunters.** At night such a swarm can appear as
little more than a mass of swirling mist, but when it prepares to
attack, the mist condenses into a dozen or more snarling wolf
heads with glowing red eyes that trail off into tendrils of fog. A
wolf spirit swarm does not eat, but the urge to hunt and kill is as
strong as ever.

**Absorb Their Kill.** Most such swarms serve powerful
undead, warlocks, noctiny, or orcish shamans as guardians and
enforcers, terrifying horses and henchmen alike. The souls of
those slain by the pack are said to join it.

**Howl Before Combat.** Hirelings, mounts, and familiars
often panic at the sound of a spirit pack’s chilling howl. Packs of
wolf spirits are canny enough to always howl for a time before
rushing a herd or encampment.

**Undead Nature.** A swarm of wolf spirits doesn’t require air,
food, drink, or sleep.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** A wolf spirit swarm uses icy doom, if it’s available,
and makes 3 bite attacks.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack.* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage. The
target is also knocked :ref:`srd:prone` if the attack scored a critical hit.

**Icy Doom (Recharge 5-6).** All creatures within 5 feet of the wolf
spirit swarm take 22 (4d10) cold damage, or half damage with
a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Those that fail
the saving throw also gain one level of :ref:`srd:exhaustion` and become
:ref:`srd:frightened` until the start of the swarm’s next turn.
