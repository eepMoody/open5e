Manabane Scarab Swarm
---------------------

*These clicking, turquoise-colored beetles have faintly luminescent
golden glyphs on their backs, which grow brighter as they draw near.*

Manabane scarabs are vermin infused with the ancient magic of
fallen desert empires.

**Devour Magic.** Whether from gnawing on the flesh of the
undead or nesting in areas rife with lingering enchantment,
these beetles have developed a taste for the power of magic
even as its power has marked them. The graven glyphs on
their carapaces resemble the priestly cuneiform of long-dead
kingdoms, and the more magical energy they consume, the
brighter they glow, up to the equivalent of a torch.

Manabane scarabs pursue magic without hesitation or fear,
tirelessly seeking to drain it for sustenance.

through any opening large enough for a Tiny
insect. The swarm can’t regain hit points or
gain temporary hit points.

**Magic Immunity.** The manabane scarab
swarm is immune to spells and other
magical effects.

**Scent Magic.** The manabane scarab swarm
can detect the presence of magical
creatures, active spells or spell effects,
and magical items within 120 feet.

**Mana Erosion.** The manabane scarab
swarm consumes magic. Unattended
magic items in the swarm’s space at the
end of the swarm’s turn have their effects
suppressed for 1 minute. Additionally,
charged items in the swarm’s space lose 1d6
charges at the start of each of the swarm’s turns; items with
limited uses per day lose one daily use instead, and single-use
items such as potions or scrolls are destroyed. Magical effects
in the swarm’s space are dispelled (as if affected by dispel
magic cast with +5 spellcasting ability).
