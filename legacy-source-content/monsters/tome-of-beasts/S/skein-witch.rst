Skein Witch
-----------

*Skein witches are androgynous humanoids mummified in writhing
diamond thread. Their skin is translucent, and suspended inside
their bodies are dozens of quivering hourglasses in place of organs.*

**Shepherd Destiny.** Skein witches are curators of destiny
and enforcers of what must be. They voyage across the planes,
weaving the strands of fate at the behest of their goddess-creator.
Although they carry out their charge without regard to petty
mortal concerns, they can be persuaded to bend fate for powerful
petitioners whose interests align with those of their goddess.

**Surrounded by Guardians.** Despite their supernatural
abilities, a skein witch’s physical body is frail. Because of that,
they tend to surround themselves with undead, constructs, or
other brutish, soulless guardians cut free from the thread of fate.

**Fear All Cards.** If a deck of many things is brought within 30
feet of a skein witch, she emits a psychic wail and disintegrates.

**Bend Fate (3/day).** If the skein witch fails a saving throw, she
may choose to succeed instead and reflect the effect of the
failed saving throw onto one enemy within 30 feet. The skein
witch still suffers the effect of a successful saving throw, if any.
The new target is entitled to a saving throw as if it were the
original target of the attack, but with disadvantage.

**Magic Resistance.** The skein witch has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Misty Step (At Will).** The skein witch can step between places
as a bonus action.

**Sealed Destiny (1/Day).** The skein witch attunes herself to
the threads of the PCs’ fates. Ask each player to write down
their prediction of how the PC to their left will die, and at what
level. Collect the notes without revealing the answers. When
one of those PCs dies, reveal the prediction. If the character
died in the manner predicted, they fulfill their destiny and are
immediately resurrected by the gods as a reward. If they died
at or within one level of the prediction, they return to life with
some useful insight into the destiny of someone important.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The
skein witch makes
two Inexorable
Thread attacks.

**Inexorable Threads.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach
30 ft., one target. *Hit:*
27 (5d8 + 5) radiant
damage, and the target
is “one step closer to
death.” If the target is
reduced to 0 hit points,
it’s treated as if it’s already
failed one death saving throw. This effect
is cumulative; each inexorable threads hit
adds one unsuccessful death saving throw. If a
character who’s been hit three or more times by
inexorable threads is reduced to 0 hit points, he
or she dies immediately. This effect lasts until the
character completes a long rest.

**Bind Fates (1/Day).** One target within 60 feet of the skein witch
must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
the target’s fate is bound to one random ally of the target.
Any damage or condition the target suffers is inflicted on the
individual to which they are bound instead, and vice versa. A
creature can be bound to only one other creature at a time.
This effect lasts until either of the affected creatures gains a
level, or until a heal or heroes' feast lifts this binding.

**Destiny Distortion Wave (Recharge 5-6).** The skein witch
projects a 60-foot cone of distortion that frays the strands of
fate. All targets in the cone take 55 (10d10) force damage, or
half damage with a successful DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. In
addition, if more than one target that failed its saving throw
is affected by a condition, those conditions are randomly
redistributed among the targets with failed saving throws.
