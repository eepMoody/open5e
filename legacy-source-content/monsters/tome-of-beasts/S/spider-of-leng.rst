Spider of Leng
--------------

*These bloated purple spiders have small claws on their
front legs that serve them as handlike manipulators.
Their abdomens are a sickly purple-white.*

**Hate Humanoids.** The nefarious spiders
of Leng are highly intelligent. They are
a very ancient race, steeped in evil lore
and hideous malice, with an abiding
hatred for all humanoid races. They
sometimes keep ghostwalk spiders
as guardians or soldiers.

**Dangerous Blood.** Their blood
is poisonous and corrosive to most
creatures native to the Material
Plane. The folk of Leng prize it in
the making of etheric harpoons and
enchanted nets.
