Red-Banded Line Spider
----------------------

*These spiders are named for both the deep red swirls on their
abdomens, unique to each spider, and for their peculiar hunting
technique. The largest ones hunt in the dark canopy of temperate
and subtropical forests.*

**Hand-Sized Hunters.** These furry, brown spiders are not
enormous monsters, but they are big enough to be alarming. A
typical one is as big as a human hand with fingers spread wide,
but some grow as large as small dogs.

**Webbed Line.** Line spiders don’t spin webs but instead perch
and watch for prey. When prey wanders near, the spider launches
a line of webbing to snare it, then pounces unerringly along that
line to deliver a deep bite. Their potent venom can incapacitate
creatures much larger than themselves, and they quickly devour
flesh with their powerful jaws.

**City Dwellers.** Line spiders are often found in cities, and
their size makes them a good replacement for a garroter crab in
certain forms of divination. They’re favorites among exotic-pet
dealers—usually with their venom sacs removed, sometimes not.
Goblins, kobolds, and some humans use them rather than cats
to control a mouse or rat infestation, and they make reasonably
good pets if they’re kept well-fed. If they get hungry, line spiders
may devour other small pets or even their owners.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
1 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10
Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and
be :ref:`srd:poisoned` until the start of the spider’s next turn. The target
fails the saving throw automatically and takes an extra 1d6
poison damage if it is bitten by another red-banded line spider
while poisoned this way.

**Swingline.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 60 ft., one
target. *Hit:* the spider immediately moves the full length of the
webbing (up to 60 feet) to the target and delivers a bite with
advantage. This attack can be used only if the spider is higher
than its target and at least 10 feet away.
