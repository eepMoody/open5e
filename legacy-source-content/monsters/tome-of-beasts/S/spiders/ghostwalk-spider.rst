Ghostwalk Spider
----------------

*A pasty-white spider the size of a horse slinks through the shadows.
Its dull eyes fix on you as it fades from sight with a ghostly blue
shimmer.*

Ghostwalk spiders are malevolent hunters that sprang from
misguided experiments on phase spiders. They are spindly,
emaciated things all but devoid of color. The spider is 8 feet in
diameter (including legs) and weighs 500 pounds.

**Phantom Webs.** Ghostwalk spiders spin ephemeral webs
in secluded areas. They spend most of their time stalking prey
to paralyze and drag back to their phantom web. As long as
these remains lie tangled in ghostly webs they go unnoticed
by material creatures, but the spiders eventually cast old kills
aside. Adventurers are wise to fear empty caves containing
unexplained, desiccated remains.

**Ghostwalk.** As a bonus action, the ghostwalk spider becomes
:ref:`srd:invisible` and intangible. Attacking doesn’t end this invisibility.
While invisible, the ghostwalk spider has advantage on
Dexterity (Stealth) checks and gains the following:

  **Damage Resistances** acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder;
  bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from
  nonmagical weapons

  **Condition Immunities** paralyzed,
  petrified, prone, restrained, stunned

The ghostwalk ends when the
spider chooses to end it as a
bonus action or when the
spider dies.

**Incorporeal Movement (During Ghostwalk Only).** The
ghostwalk spider can move through other creatures and
objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force
damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Spider Climb.** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including
upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability
check.

**Web Walker.** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused
by webbing.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The ghostwalk spider makes two bite attacks. It
can make a ghostly snare attack in place of one of its bites.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) poison damage,
or half poison damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution
saving throw. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit
points, the target is stable but poisoned and paralyzed for 1
hour, even after regaining hit points. While using Ghostwalk,
the spider’s bite and poison do half damage to targets that
aren’t affected by Ghostly Snare (see below).

**Ghostly Snare (During Ghostwalk Only, Recharge 5-6).**
Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 40/160 ft., one
target. *Hit:* The target is :ref:`srd:restrained` by ghostly webbing. While
restrained in this way, the target is :ref:`srd:invisible` to all creatures
except ghostwalk spiders, and it has resistance to acid, cold,
fire, lightning, and thunder damage. A creature restrained
by Ghostly Snare can escape by using an action to make a
successful DC 14 Strength check, or the webs can be attacked
and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5).
