Stryx
-----

*Stryx are the result of the Moonlit
King’s mad experiments deep within the
plane of Shadows. They resemble owls
and can pass as normal birds as long as
they don’t speak or open their mouths.
The stryx have a larger mouth hidden
behind their beaks, filled with gleaming
human teeth. Stryx range in color from pale
gray to sooty black, with gleaming eyes.*

**Strange Alchemy.** The stryx are
unnatural beings that came about
through terrible manipulation of
normal owls and kidnapped humans. The
Moonlit King, is desperate to touch the
outside world. His crazed experiments blended
shreds of mortal souls into shadowy owls and thus
brought the stryx into being.

**The Shadow’s Eyes.** The truth of the stryx is all but
unknown outside the Moonlit King’s inner circle,
where these creatures serve as the king’s eyes and ears.
Stryx thrive in the plane of Shadow and on the Material Plane
equally, and they enjoy attaching themselves to powerful beings
as spies, servants, and translators. Their purposes are muddied,
however, because they constantly relay what they learn to their
mad creator.
