Suturefly
---------

*These darting creatures resemble dragonflies, but with three pairs
of gossamer wings and a body made from splintered wood. Flashes
of bright colors run along their bodies.*

**Sew Mouths Shut.** Forest folk
rarely speak when sutureflies dart
through the trees, because these
creatures listen for lies and sew any
offender’s mouth, nose, and eyes shut.
Some say the old woods hide nothing
but liars, and that is why the deepest
forest is shrouded in silence.
Others say that the forest
uses sutureflies to smother
those who break its covenants or
reveal its secrets.

Adventurers see a suturefly’s
handiwork more often than they
glimpse one of the creatures
directly: corpses with mouths and noses
stitched shut lie in the underbrush, mysterious
children whose mouths are ringed with black puncture marks
observe intruders from afar, and dryads step from trees, their
eyes sewn shut against the evils of civilization.

**Seek Out Curses.** Numerous suturefly varieties exist. Some
attack based on verbal triggers other than lies. Black‑banded
sutureflies, for instance, detect curses and religious blasphemies.
When attacking, sutureflies dart from hiding to gain surprise.
Once they sew someone’s mouth closed, they target the
same victim’s nose, unless threatened by another opponent.
Sutureflies attack until they have sewn all of their opponents’
mouths, eyes and noses closed or until they’re destroyed.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Sew.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
1 piercing damage, and the suturefly sews the target’s mouth,
nose, or eye closed. With supernatural speed, the suturefly
repeatedly pierces the target’s face, each time threading a
loop of the target’s own skin through the previous hole. These
skin loops rapidly blacken, shrink, and draw the orifice tightly
closed. It takes two actions and a sharp blade to sever the
loops and reopen the orifice, and the process causes intense
pain and 2 slashing damage. A victim whose mouth and nose
have been sewn shut begins :ref:`srd:suffocating` at the start of his or
her next turn.
