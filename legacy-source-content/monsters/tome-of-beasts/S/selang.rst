Selang
------

*This grinning humanoid looks like a handsome man, though his
skin is black as obsidian, his eye glow red, and he has both insectoid
legs and antennae.*

**Dark Satyrs.** The selang or dark satyrs are twisted and vicious
fauns who have abandoned nature worship, and instead venerate
ancient gods of deep and malign intelligence. Selangs seek to help
those evil gods enter the mortal world by opening dark portals
and bridging a path to realms beyond mortal understanding.

**Battle Song and Laughter.** Selangs relish battle, pain, and
torture—they find violence thrilling and bloodshed exciting, and
they often laugh, sing, and boast shamelessly during combat.
Although they are the diplomats and spokesmen of the old
gods, their manic speech and alien logic can be hard to follow,
requiring an Intelligence check (DC 16) to understand a dark
satyr each round. They are most comfortable with the slithering
tones of the Void Speech.

**Blasphemous Music.** Their cults and settlements are often
found at the sites sacred to the dark gods, making hypnotic and
alien harmonies with swarms of dorreqi. They are rarely the
strongest soldiers, instead encouraging evil humanoids or other
creatures of martial mien to fill the ranks, while the dark satyrs
use their magic and poison against their foes.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The selang’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:dancing-lights`, :ref:`srd:minor-illusion`

**3/day:** :ref:`srd:alter-self`, :ref:`srd:fear`, :ref:`srd:sleep`, :ref:`srd:suggestion`

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The selang makes two dagger attacks or two short
bow attacks.

**Dagger.** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft.
or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage,
plus sleep poison.

**Short Bow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 80/320, one
target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus sleep poison.

**Sleep Poison.** Dark satyrs coat their weapons with a sleep poison
made from the brain fluids of dorreqi. Any creature not immune
to poison injured by a selang blade or arrow must succeed on a
DC 14 Constitution saving throw or fall asleep for 2d6 rounds.

**Alien Piping.** A selang can confuse and injure its enemies by
playing weird, ear-bending harmonies on alien pipes, made
from the beaks, cartilage, and throat sacs of a dorreq. When
the selang plays a tune on these pipes, all creatures within 60
feet must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be
affected by :ref:`srd:contagion`, :ref:`srd:confusion`, :ref:`srd:irresistible-dance`, or :ref:`srd:hideous-laughter`, depending on what alien and otherworldly music the
dark satyr chooses to play. A creature that saves successfully
against this psychic effect is immune to the piping for 24 hours.
The selang can use each of these spell-like effects once per day.
