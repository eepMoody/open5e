Vine Troll Skeleton
-------------------

*These troll skeletons are completely covered in mold and wrapped
in flowering vines, and lurk in the shadows of dead tree and
profaned groves.*

**Black Earth Magic.** Vine troll skeletons guard duskthorn
dryad glades and the sacred circles of druids; others serve the
vila or even moss lurker colonies as guardians. In each case,
they were created by dark earth magic for a purpose, and that
energy empowers great strength and endurance—but little in
the way of wits.

**Constant Regrowth.** Their vines regenerate quickly, even
after they die. Their powerful regeneration allows vine troll
skeletons to reattach severed limbs. Only fire or acid can destroy
them and render the living vines harmless.

**Bound to a Tree’s Heart.** Vine troll skeletons are direct
offshoots of the main vine wrapped around a duskthorn dryad’s tree, a treant, or a weeping treant. Vine troll skeletons
are mindless aside from a desire to defend their parent tree,
and enchanted troll hearts inside the tree provide their power.
Destroying the heart at the center of the tree kills the skeleton
bound to that heart instantly.

hit points and doesn’t regenerate, or if the duskthorn
dryad who created it dies, or if the troll’s heart inside the
dryad's or treant's tree is destroyed.
