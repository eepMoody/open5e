Spider Thief
------------

*This clockwork spider creature is the size of a dog. Each of its eight
sharp, sickle-like feet stabs or sinks slightly into the ground. Razor
wire enwraps its body, while gyros whirl visibly in its faceless,
clockwork head.*

**Wire Fighters.** A spider thief never initiates combat unless
ordered to, but it always defends itself against attack. Its initial
attack is whirling its razor line to entangle a target. Once it
snares a foe, the spider thief keeps attacking that target until it
stops resisting or it escapes from the spider’s wire. By then, it
should be ready to ensnare a new victim.

**Completely Loyal.** This clockwork machine follows orders
from its master even if they lead to its destruction, and it ﬁghts
until destroyed or told to stand down. The machine recognizes
only its creator as its master.

**Guild Tools.** The spider thief got its name because its ability to
climb walls and to effortlessly cross gaps between buildings up
to 20 feet wide makes it an excellent accomplice for enterprising
thieves. Some thieves guilds make extensive use of them, and
many freelance rogues use them as partners.

**Constructed Nature.** A spider thief doesn’t require air,
food, drink, or sleep.

**Magic Resistance.** The spider thief has advantage

**Wire-Assisted Jump.** If its razor line attack is available,
a spider thief can use its movement to leap 20 feet in
any direction by launching the wire like a spider’s web
so that it spears or snags an object, then immediately
reeling it back in. It can carry up to 25 lb. of additional
weight while moving this way. Moving this way doesn’t
expend its razor line attack.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The spider thief makes two sickle claw attacks.

**Sickle Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 10 (2d8 + 1) slashing damage.

**Razor Line (Recharge 5-6).** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit,
reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (1d4 + 1) slashing damage, and
the target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 10). Instead of moving,
the spider thief can retract the razor line and pull itself onto
the grappled creature (the spider thief enters and remains in
the target’s space). The spider thief’s sickle claw attacks have
advantage against a grappled creature in the same space. If
the grappled creature escapes, the spider thief immediately
displaces into an unoccupied space within 5 feet.
