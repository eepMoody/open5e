Nightgarm
---------

*These humanoid creatures work with their lupine mother and their
worg and winter wolf brothers and sisters to destroy human and
dwarvish settlements. Their howls are songs of vengeance, and their
fangs and jaws seem ready to swallow the world.*

**Champions of the Northern Packs.**
Created in a magical ritual performed
over a pregnant :ref:`srd:worg` by her
packmates, nightgarms are
always female and are always
loyal followers of Fenris. They
are dedicated to harassing
servants of the gods,
especially the northern
gods of the sky,
thunder, or wisdom.
Their spawn infiltrate
settlements to bring them
down—treachery that always
ends with a massed attack by wolves.

**Carry Off Plunder.** Nightgarms
resemble enormous wolves, but up
close their wide mouths, hate-filled
eyes, and half-formed fingers give
them away as something different
from—and much worse than—
worgs. They can wield items in
their front paws and can walk
on their hind limbs when
necessary, though they are far
swifter on four legs.

**Impossibly Wide Jaws.** A
nightgarm’s jaws can open
to swallow corpses, living
creatures, and items larger
than themselves, a magical
trick that happens in a
matter of seconds.

**Spawn Falseman.** If a nightgarm spends an entire round
consuming a humanoid corpse, it immediately becomes
pregnant. Nine hours later, it gives birth to a duplicate of the
devoured creature. Known as a ‘falseman,’ this duplicate has all
the memories and characteristics of the original but serves its
mother loyally, somewhat similar to a familiar’s relationship to
a wizard. A nightgarm can have up to 14 falsemen under her
control at a time. A nightgarm can communicate telepathically
with its falsemen at ranges up to 200 feet.

**Distending Maw.** Like snakes, nightgarms can open their
mouths far wider than other creatures of similar size. This ability
grants it a formidable bite and allows it to swallow creatures up
to Medium size.

**Superstitious.** A nightgarm must stay at least 5 feet away from
a brandished holy symbol or a burning sprig of wolf’s bane,
and it cannot touch or make melee attacks against a creature
holding one of these items. After 1 round, the nightgarm
can make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw at the start of each
of its turns; if the save succeeds, the nightgarm temporarily
overcomes its superstition and these restrictions are lifted until
the start of the nightgarm’s next turn.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The nightgarm’s innate spellcasting ability
is Charisma (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:darkness`, *dissonant whispers*, :ref:`srd:hold-person`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:conjure-woodland-beings` (wolves only), :ref:`srd:dimension-door`, :ref:`srd:scrying` (targets falsemen only)

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 27 (4d10 + 5) piercing damage, and a Medium or smaller
target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or
be swallowed whole. A swallowed creature is :ref:`srd:blinded` and
:ref:`srd:restrained` and has total cover against attacks and other effects
outside the nightgarm. It takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the
start of each of the nightgarm’s turns. A nightgarm can have
only one creature swallowed at a time.
If the nightgarm takes 25 damage or more on a single turn
from the swallowed creature, the nightgarm must succeed
on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn
or regurgitate the creature, which falls :ref:`srd:prone` within 5 feet of
the nightgarm. If the nightgarm dies, a swallowed creature is
no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by
using 10 feet of movement, exiting :ref:`srd:prone`.
