Naina
-----

*These drakes are resplendent in their natural form, plumed and
scaled in glittering, multicolored hues. In humanoid form, they
appear as elderly homespun human crones or as young,
beautiful elvish women.*

**Drakes in Human Form.** These faerie drakes can take the
shape of wise, old, human women. They retain full use of their
sorcerous powers in their humanoid forms, and they can retain
that form indefinitely.

**Difficult to Spot.** A naina shapeshifted into human form
is nearly impossible to spot as anything but human unless she
makes a mistake that gives away her true nature, and they seldom
do. Draconic roars, a flash of scales, a fondness for raw meat, and
a flash of wrathful dragon breath are the most common tells.

**Hunted by Rumor.** When rumors of a naina circulate, any
woman who is a stranger may be persecuted, ostracized, or even
tortured unless she can prove that she’s entirely human.

**Magic Sensitive.** The naina detects magic as if it were
permanently under the effect of a :ref:`srd:detect-magic` spell.

**Spellcasting.** The naina is a 9th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting
ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell
attacks). The naina has the following sorcerer spells prepared:

**Cantrips (at will):** :ref:`srd:dancing-lights`, :ref:`srd:mage-hand`, :ref:`srd:mending`, :ref:`srd:ray-of-frost`, :ref:`srd:resistance`, :ref:`srd:silent-image`

**1st level (4 slots):** :ref:`srd:charm-person`, :ref:`srd:thunderwave`, *witch bolt*

**2nd level (3 slots):** :ref:`srd:darkness`, :ref:`srd:invisibility`, :ref:`srd:locate-object`

**3rd level (3 slots):** :ref:`srd:dispel-magic`, :ref:`srd:hypnotic-pattern`

**4th level (3 slots):** :ref:`srd:dimension-door`

**5th level (1 slot):** :ref:`srd:dominate-person`

**Shapechanger.** The naina can use her action to polymorph
into one of her two forms: a drake or a female humanoid. She
cannot alter either form’s appearance or capabilities (with the
exception of her breath weapon) using this ability, and damage
sustained in one form transfers to the other form.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The naina makes two claw attacks and one bite
attack.

**Bite (drake form only).** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (3d12 + 5) piercing damage.

**Claw (drake form only).** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (3d12 + 5) slashing damage.

**Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6).** While in drake form (only), the
naina breathes a 20-foot cone of poison gas, paralytic gas, or
sleep gas.

**Poison.** A creature caught in this poison gas takes 18
(4d8) poison damage and is :ref:`srd:poisoned`; a successful DC 17
Constitution saving throw reduces damage to half and negates
the poisoned condition. While poisoned this way, the creature
must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
On a failure, it takes 9 (2d8) poison damage and the poisoning
continues; on a success, the poisoning ends.

**Paralysis.** A creature caught in this paralytic gas must succeed
on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be :ref:`srd:paralyzed` for 2d4
rounds. A paralyzed creature repeats the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns; a successful save ends the paralysis.

**Sleep.** A creature caught in this sleeping gas must succeed on
a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or fall :ref:`srd:unconscious` for 6
rounds. A sleeping creature repeats the saving throw at the end
of each of its turns; it wakes up if it makes the save successfully.
