Forest Marauder
---------------

*A primitive and relatively diminutive form of giant, forest
marauders claim the wilderness areas farthest from civilization
when they can.*

**Painted Skin.** Roughly the size and shape of an ogre, this
brutish thing is covered in paint or colored mud. An exaggerated
brow ridge juts out over piggish, close-set eyes, and corded
muscle stands out all over the creature.

**Keep to the Wilderness.**
Cruel and savage when
encountered, their demeanor
has worked against them and they have
nearly been driven to extinction in places where
they can be easily tracked. They have since learned to
raid far from their hidden homes, leading to sightings in
unexpected places.

**Orc Friends.** Forest marauders get along well with orcs and
goblins, who appreciate their brute strength and their skill at
night raids.
