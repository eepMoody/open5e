Fraughashar
-----------

*This slight creature resembles a goblin, but its blue skin and the
icicles hanging from the tip of its long nose speak to the chilling truth.*

The fraughashar are a race of short, tricky, and cruel fey who
inhabit cold mountainous regions. Fraughashar have light blue
skin, short pointed ears, and needlelike teeth. Delighting in
mayhem, they always seem to have devilish grins on their faces.

**Sacred Rivers.** They view cold rivers and river gorges as
sacred places in which their wicked god Fraugh dwells, and they
likewise revere the snowy peaks where the Snow Queen holds
sway. Fraughashar are fiercely protective of their territory, and
their easy mobility over frozen and rocky terrain lets them make
short work of intruders.

**Chilling Tales.** The origin of the strange and deadly
fraughashar is unclear. Some druidic legends claim the
fraughashar were born out of a winter so cold and cruel that
the spirits of the river itself froze. Bardic tales claim that the
fraughashar are a tribe of corrupted goblins, and that they
were permanently disfigured during a botched attempt at
summoning an ice devil. Whatever the truth of their beginnings,
the fraughashar are cruel and merciless, and they will kill anyone
who enters their land.
