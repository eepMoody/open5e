Firegeist
---------

*Made of fiery smoke coalescing into a vaguely humanoid shape,
a firegeist is little more than wisps of black smoke and spots of
brighter flame.*

**Elemental Echoes.** When a fire elemental meets its
destruction in a particularly humiliating fashion while
summoned away from its home plane, what returns is a firegeist.
Malevolent and resentful, less than their former prideful selves,
they exist for revenge.

**Indiscrimate Arsonists.** Firegeists are not adept at telling
one humanoid from another, and so burning any similar
creature will do, providing it is flammable.

**Brighter Light, Darker Smoke.** A firegeist can shine
brightly or be primarily smoky and dark, as it wishes. It always
sheds a little light, like a hooded lantern.

**Elemental Nature.** A firegeist doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

*Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

**Combustion Touch (Recharge 5-6).** The firegeist may
ignite a target when making a slam attack. The target must
immediately succeed at a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or
catch ﬁre, taking an additional 5 (1d10) fire damage at the
beginning of its next turn. Until someone takes an action to
douse the fire, the creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the
start of each of its turns.
