*Taut dead skin, adorned entirely with tattooed fish scales, covers
this woman’s face and hands. She wears scaled armor, sea green
like verdigris on copper, and wields a strange sword. Her pale eyes
stare, unblinking.*

**Undead Warlock Slaves.** Ancient and powerful beings
across the multiverse grant magical knowledge to mortals
through dangerous pacts. Those bound to these pacts become
warlocks, but the will and force of their patron is borne by more
than just those who strike bargains for sorcerous power. A fext
is a former warlock who has become wholly dedicated to their
patron—mind, body, and soul—and functions as enforcer,
bodyguard, and assassin. They are powerful undead slaves to the
will of their otherworldly patron.

**Linked to a Master.** Each fext is a unique servant of their
patron and exhibits the physical traits of its master. The
eyes of every fext are tied directly to their patron’s mind,
who can see what the fext sees at any time. The fext also
possesses a telepathic link to its patron.

The process a warlock undergoes to become a fext is
horrendous. The warlock is emptied of whatever morality
and humanity he or she had as wine from a jug, and the
patron imbues the empty vessel with its corruption
and unearthly will. Whatever life the fext led
before is completely gone. They exist only to
serve.

**Outdoing Rivals.** Scholars have debated about
how many fext a patron can command. The more
powerful and well-established have at least 100,
while others have only a handful. Where there is
more than one fext, however, they maneuverings amongst
themselves to curry favor with their powerful lord. Each
fext is bound to obey commands, but they attempt to carry
them out to the detriment of their competitors. Scheming
is common and rampant among them and they try to work
without the aid of other fext as much as possible.

**Undead Nature.** A fext doesn’t require air, food, drink,
or sleep.
