Far Darrig
----------

*These shy fairies dress as small fey herdsmen wearing tan hide
armor, hide boots, cloaks, and cowls, all trimmed in fox fur and
often with a red sash or tunic. They often ride woodland creatures,
such as dire weasels or snowy owls.*

**Hunters & Herders.** The far darrig were the hunters,
herders, and equerry of the elven nobility—some still serve in
this capacity in planes where the elves rule. Some stayed behind
after the many of the fey retreated to wilder lands in the face of
expanding human kingdoms.

Far darrig carry glaives made from fey antlers; each remains
enchanted only as long as a far darrig holds it. Their leaders
ride on fey elk the color of foxes, with gleaming green eyes; it is
believed that their antlers are the ones used to make far darrig
antler glaives.

**Hate Arcanists.** While not inherently evil, far darrig are
hostile to all humans and will often attack human wizards,
warlocks, and sorcerers on sight. If they can be moved to a
friendly attitude through Persuasion or a charm spell or effect,
they make very good guides, scouts, and hunters.

**Serve Hags and Worse.** They are sometimes found as thralls
or scouts serving hags, trollkin, and shadow fey, but they are
unwilling and distrustful allies at best.

chooses which effect occurs.

**Enchanted Glaive Maneuvers.** A far darrig can magically
extend or shrink its antler glaive as a bonus action to give it
either a 10-foot or 5-foot reach.
