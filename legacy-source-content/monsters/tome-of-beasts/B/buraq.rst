Buraq
-----

*An aura of holiness surrounds this handsome human-headed
equine with its short but strong feathered wings.*

**Only the Worthy.** A buraq possesses astounding speed,
determination, and resilience, among a host of noble qualities,
but only pure-hearted humanoids can obtain a service from such
a righteous and honorable creature.

**Angel Marked.** Every buraq wears a gilded band around its
head or neck. These are said to be angelic seals or wardings, each
different. The hide of every buraq is white, though their beards,
lashes, manes, and tails vary from silver and dusty tan to deep
brown or glossy black.

**Heavenly Steeds.** A buraq is smaller than a mule but bigger
than a donkey, though their carrying capacity belies their size
and apparent strength. Nevertheless, a buraq is the ultimate
courier and a heavenly steed. Paladins and good-aligned clerics
are the most likely candidates to ride a buraq, but other virtuous
characters have had this privilege.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The buraq’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 17). The buraq can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no components:

:ref:`srd:pass-without-trace`

**Magic Resistance.** The buraq has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

**Night Journey.** When outdoors at night, a buraq’s vision is not
limited by nonmagical darkness. Once per month, the buraq
can declare it is on a night journey; for the next 24 hours, it can
use its Teleport once per round. Its destination must always
be in an area of nonmagical darkness within its line of sight.
At any point during the night journey, as a bonus action, the
buraq can return itself and its rider to the location where it
began the night journey.
