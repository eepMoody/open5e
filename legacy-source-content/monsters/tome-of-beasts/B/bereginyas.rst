Bereginyas
----------

*These small, winged faeries appear to be made out of gray mist,
and can conceal themselves completely in the fogbanks and clouds
enshrouding their mountainous lairs.*

**Mist Dancers.** These evil and cunning faeries (whose name
means “mist dancers” in Old Elvish) overcome their victims by
seeping into their lungs and choking them on the bereginyas’s
foul essence.

**Mountain Spirits.** They are most commonly found in the
highest mountain ranges, often above the treeline, but they
can be encountered in any foggy or misty mountainous region.
Shepherds and goatherds often leave bits of milk or cheese to
placate them; these offerings are certainly welcome during the
spring lambing season.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The bereginyas makes two claw attacks. If both
attacks hit the same target, the target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC
12) and the bereginyas immediately uses Smother against it as
a bonus action.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage.

**Smother.** If the bereginyas grapples an opponent, it extends
a semi-solid gaseous tendril down the target’s throat as
a bonus action. The target must make a successful DC 14
Strength saving or it is immediately out of breath and begins
:ref:`srd:suffocating`. Suffocation ends if the grapple is broken or if the
bereginyas is killed.
