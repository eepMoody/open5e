Burrowling
----------

*These light brown, furred creatures inquisitively survey their
surroundings, each comforted by the presence of the others.*

**Friendly Farmers.** Burrowlings work together at every task:
digging tunnels, foraging, and rearing their young. They are
omnivorous, eating roots, berries, insects, and reptiles—and
they consider snakes a particular delicacy. The most advanced
burrowling towns set up rudimentary farms, where they grow
the fruits and vegetables they usually find in the wild.

**Safe Warrens.** Some towns have domesticated prairie dogs,
which burrowlings train to stand watch alongside their masters.
Pairs of adults stand watch around the town perimeter and
sound a warning when they spot a foe. An alerted town retreats
to the safety of its warrens, while the strongest creatures
add more tunnels if necessary, and close access from the
surface until the threat has passed. In combat, burrowlings
stand together in defense of the helpless young and fight
with crude slings or their sharp teeth and claws.

**Die of Loneliness.** If separated from its coterie, a
burrowling becomes despondent, crying for others of its kind.
A lone burrowling usually dies of loneliness within a week,
unless it can find its way back to its town or discover another
burrowling town. Rarely, a solitary creature makes its way to a
non-burrowling settlement where it attempts to assist its new
community. This frustrates the creature and those it interacts
with as it tries to anticipate what its companions want. It
may join an adventuring party in the hope of returning to a
settlement. After spending at least six months with a party, the
burrowling can use its Burrow Tactics ability with its new allies.

Burrowlings live up to 15 years. Twice a year, a burrowling
female bears a litter of up to three pups, but in especially
dangerous regions, the creatures breed prodigiously to keep
their population ahead of massive attrition. In cases like this, a
female has a litter of five pups every other month. A burrowling
pup reaches adulthood in a year.
