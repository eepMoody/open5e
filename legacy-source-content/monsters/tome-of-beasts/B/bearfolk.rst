Bearfolk
--------

*Although it has the head of a shaggy bear, this humanoid creature
wears armor and carries a battleaxe in one massive, clawed hand
and a warhammer in the other. Itâ€™s a solid slab of muscle that
towers imposingly over most humans.*

The hulking bearfolk are intimidating creatures. Brutish and
powerful, they combine features of humanoid beings and
bears. Their heads are ursine with heavy jaws and sharp
teeth. Dark fur covers their bodies, which are packed
with muscle. Adult bearfolk stand at least 7 feet tall
and weigh more than 600 pounds.

**Sworn to the Bear King.** Bearfolk are almost
universally the subjects of the Bear King, one of the
great fey lords. The bearfolk protect the cities of
their northern kingdom and roam the wooded
roads of the wilderness. The greatest number of
bearfolk are concentrated around the court
of the Bear King himself, with ancient bear
jarls governing their unruly kin. Only a
handful of renegades, exiles, and other
rogue bearfolk live permanently outside
this society.

**Passionate and Volatile.**
Boisterous and jovial, the bearfolk
are a people of extremes. They
celebrate with great passion and are
quick to explosive anger. Settling
differences with wrestling matches
that leave permanent scars is
common, as is seeing two bloodied
bearfolk sharing a cask of mead and
a raucous song after such a scuffle.
