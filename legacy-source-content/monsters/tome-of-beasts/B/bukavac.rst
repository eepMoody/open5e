Bukavac
-------

*Unleashing a bone-shattering roar, this toad-like monster bears
two gnarled horns and wicked claws. It charges from its watery lair
on six legs, eager for the kill.*

**Pond Lurkers.** The placid surfaces of forest lakes and ponds
hide many lethal threats, among them the bukavac. While not
amphibious, the creature can hold its breath for minutes at a
time as it lurks under the surface in wait for fresh meat.

**Enormous Roar.** A ravenous bukavac lives to hunt
and devour prey, preferring intelligent prey to
animals, and usually ambushes its victims.
Due to its size, the beast must find
deep ponds or lakes to hide in, but it
can flatten itself comfortably to rest
in two feet of water. It leads with its
wicked horns before grabbing hold
of its target or another nearby foe
and hanging on as it claws its victim
to death. The creature relishes the
feel of its victim’s struggles to escape
its embrace and reserves its roar,
which sounds like a cross between
a toad’s croak and lion’s roar
emanating from a creature the size
of a dragon, for organized foes or
against overwhelming numbers. If a bukavac’s devastating
sonic attack routs its foes, it picks off remaining stragglers;
otherwise, it retreats to its underwater hiding spot.

**Clamorous Mating.** Solitary hunters by nature, bukavacs
pair up briefly in the spring. Male bukavacs travel to a female’s
lair and demonstrate their prowess by unleashing their most
powerful bellows. Villages ten miles away from the lair often
hear these howls for a week and pray that the creatures don’t
attack. Once mating has been completed (and groves of trees
have been destroyed), the female finds a secluded, shallow lake
in which to bury eggs. A bukavac reaches maturity in five years,
during which time it and its siblings hunt together. After the
bukavacs mature, each finds its own lair.

A bukavac is 11 feet long, including its foot-long horns, stands
four feet tall, and weighs 4,000 lb. The creature has a natural
lifespan of 40 years, but its noise and proclivity to ambush
intelligent prey attracts the attention of hunting parties, which
considerably shorten its life expectancy.
