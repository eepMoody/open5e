Lemurfolk (Kaguani)
-------------------

*This furred humanoid glides silently through the canopy of trees,
gripping a blowgun. It observes visitors cautiously with two
intelligent, bulbous eyes.*

**Jungle Rulers.** These small, intelligent, squirrel-like
humanoids live in reclusive, primitive societies deep in the jungle.
They are omnivorous, subsisting on fruits and roots, insects and
larvae, bird and snake eggs, and birds and small mammals. They
sometimes barter with more advanced creatures for metal and
crafted items.

**Nocturnal Gliders.** Lemurfolk are nocturnal, though they
can adopt daytime hours when they must. They prefer to hunt
and move by gliding between trees, catching prey off guard.

**Greyfur Elders.** Greyfurs are the eldest and most revered
kaguani, as much as 80 years old; their age can be estimated by
the graying of their fur, but they don’t track the years. Greyfurs
are cunning individuals and command the arcane arts, though
they rarely pursue the art of necromancy—a strong taboo
prohibits them from interacting with the dead.

A typical lemurfolk stands 2 feet tall and weighs 30 lb.
