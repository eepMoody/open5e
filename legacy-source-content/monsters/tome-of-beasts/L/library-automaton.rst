Library Automaton
-----------------

*The humming of servos, ticking of gears, and petite discharges of
steam alert you to the presence of this library’s diminutive custodian.*

These small constructs were created to fulfill organizational
responsibilities of huge libraries with staffing problems, but
some invariably learn enough about the wider world to seek out
adventure and new knowledge, rather than tending the items in
their care.

**Eyes of the Past.** While largely constructed with
mechanical components, the automatons include a single
human eyeball that is mounted at the end of an articulated
appendage. The eye is usually donated by one of the
institution’s scholars (prescribed in their will) so that they can
continue serving the repositories of knowledge that were their
life’s work.

**Telekinetic.** While the automatons have no arms, they can
move and manipulate written materials telekinetically. Powered
by keen analytical engines, the library automaton tirelessly
pores through tomes, translates ancient texts,
catalogs the institution’s volumes, fetches
texts for visitors, and occasionally rids the
vast halls of uninvited pests.

**Sought by Wizards.** Wizards
have discovered that these clockwork
bureaucrats make particularly effective
caretakers for their spellbooks and scrolls
while on adventure.

**Constructed Nature.** A library
automaton doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

**Extra-Dimensional Book Repository.** A small door
on the chest of the library automaton opens into an
extra‑dimensional bookcase. This bookcase functions exactly
as a bag of holding except that it can store only written
materials such as books, scrolls, tomes, parchment, folders,
notebooks, spellbooks, and the like.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Gaze of Confusion.** The library automaton chooses one
creature it can see within 40 feet. The target must succeed on
a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or take 9 (3d4 + 2) psychic
damage and have disadvantage on Intelligence-based checks,
saving throws, and attacks until the end of its next turn. If the
saving throw succeeds, then the target takes half damage and
suffers no other effect.

**Bibliotelekinesis.** This ability functions as the cantrip mage
hand but can be used only on books, scrolls, maps, and other
printed or written materials.
