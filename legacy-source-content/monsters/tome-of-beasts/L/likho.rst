Likho
-----

*Malformed like a goblin, this creature bears one large, strange
eye in the middle of its face. It wears dark and dirty rags, and its
spindly claws and arms match its hunched torso.*

**Ferocious Attitude.** Likho are scrappy fighters; they weaken
foes from afar with their magical attacks to curse and enfeeble
enemies, then rush forward in a blazing charge and jump onto
their foes, shredding them with their claws. Once a likho has
leapt onto a creature, it shreds flesh using the claws on both its
hands and feet.

**Jeers and Insults.** A likho uses its message spells to taunt and
jeer its target from a distance during the hunt. In addition, to
flinging curses and ill luck, likho frustrate and infuriate their
enemies because they are difficult to hit. A likho enjoys stalking
intelligent humanoids and tormenting them from hiding until
discovered or when it grows tired of the hunt.

**Organ Eaters.** Likho thrive when they drain away luck and
aptitude. Once the likho immobilizes a creature, it gnaws at the
creature’s abdomen with its jagged teeth, devouring the organs
of its still-living prey. A likho consumes only a humanoid’s
organs and leaves the rest of the carcass behind.

the likho can use a bonus action to make two additional claw
