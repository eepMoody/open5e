Lich Hound
----------

*Their howls echoing from another plane, lich
hounds always arrive wreathed in mist. Half
bone, half purple fire, they are creatures of
hunger and the hunt. Nothing makes them
happier than taking down creatures larger
than themselves—or racing through the air
to catch a surprised bat in mid-flight. All
cruelty and fang, lich hounds are most
satisfied when praised by their great
undead lords.*

**Fiery Bones.** Bright white
skulls with a heavy jaw and thick,
robust skeletal bodies define
the ferocious lich hounds. Their
eyes burn green or blue, and
their tongues resemble black fire.
Fueled by necromantic power,
these creatures are loyal servants of
either ghoul high priests or liches.

**Echoing Howls.** Even on their
own, lich hounds are relentless
hunters, pursuing their prey
with powerful senses and a
keen ability to find the living
wherever they may hide. Lich
hound howls fade into and out
of normal hearing, with strangely
shifted pitch and echoes.

**Murdered Celestials.** The dark process of creating a lich
hound involves a perverse ritual of first summoning a celestial
canine and binding it to the Material Plane. The hound’s future
master then murders the trapped beast. Only then can the
creature be animated in all its unholy glory. Hound archons
have long been outraged by the creation of lich hounds, and they
occasionally band together to rid the world of those who practice
this particular dark magic.

**Undead Nature.** A lich hound doesn’t require air, food, drink,
or sleep.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 10 (1d12 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature,
it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be
knocked :ref:`srd:prone`.

**Ethereal Jaunt.** As a bonus action, the lich hound can magically
shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, or vice versa.

**Gut Rip.** As a bonus action, the lich hound tears into any
adjacent prone creature, inflicting 19 (3d12) slashing damage.
The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw
or be :ref:`srd:incapacitated` for 1d4 rounds. An incapacitated creature
repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns; a
successful save ends the condition early.

**Howl.** The eerie howl of lich hounds as they close in on their
prey plays havoc on the morale of living creatures that hear
it. Howling requires and action, and creatures that hear the
howl of a lich hound within 100 feet must succeed on a DC
14 Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for 5 rounds.
Creatures that successfully save against this effect cannot be
affected by a lich hound’s howl for 24 hours.
