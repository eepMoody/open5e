Leshy
-----

*A leshy is a strange man wearing loose scraps of clothing and
covered in bark and root-like growths. The hair and beard that
frame his piercing green eyes writhe like living vines.*

**Expanding the Wild.** Solitary leshy tend plants and animals
in groves around great forests, and they are the self-proclaimed
protectors of the forest outskirts. Leshy have little patience for
interlopers and often kill, abduct, or frighten off trailblazers and
guides. With their plant growth ability, they sabotage cultivated
land, wipe out trails, and create weed walls and thickets to
keep civilization at bay. Using speak with plants, they transplant
dangerous plant creatures to discourage new settlements. Some
have wrangled rabid animals to the same purpose.

**Ax Thieves.** Leshy prefer trickery to combat, particularly
enjoying leading interlopers astray through use of their mimicry.
If challenged, they use their ability to change size to scare
intruders away, but they never hesitate to fight to the death in
service to the forest if necessary. Leshy hate metal, especially
axes, and they go out of their way to steal metal items and lead
those who use them astray.

**Accept Bribes.** With careful courting and appropriate gifts,
it is possible to gain a leshy’s capricious assistance. This can be
risky, because leshy love mischief. Still, at times a leshy’s help is
essential to a group traversing ancient woodlands.

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP)

**Innate Spellcasting.** The leshy’s innate
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save
DC 13). It can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:animal-friendship`, :ref:`srd:pass-without-trace`, :ref:`srd:speak-with-animals`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:entangle`, :ref:`srd:plant-growth`, :ref:`srd:shillelagh`,
:ref:`srd:speak-with-plants`, :ref:`srd:hideous-laughter`

**Camouflage.** A leshy has advantage on Stealth checks if
it is at least lightly obscured by foliage.

**Mimicry.** A leshy can mimic the calls and voices
of any creature it has heard. To use this ability,
the leshy makes a Charisma (Deception) check.
Listeners who succeed on an opposed Wisdom (Insight) or
Intelligence (Nature)—DM’s choice—realize that something is
mimicking the sound. The leshy has advantage on the check if
it’s mimicking a general type of creature (a crow’s call, a bear’s
roar) and not a specific individual’s voice.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The leshy makes two club attacks.

**Change Size.** The leshy appears to change its size, becoming
as tall as a massive oak (Gargantuan) or as short as a blade
of grass (Tiny). The change is entirely illusory, so the leshy’s
statistics do not change.

**Club.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
