Lantern Dragonette
------------------

*This cat-sized drake with a waxy appearance and a glow
emanating from its belly can hover in midair, filling a small area
with a warm glow.*

The lantern drake is named for its belly, which glows with a
warm light. The beast's yellow, waxy scales darken with
age, though lantern drakes rarely live more than 50 years
or so. They weigh from 5 to 10 pounds and are 18 inches
long. Most believe they are the result of an arcane
fusion of a radiant spirit with a paper drake.

**Eat Candle Wax.** The drake devours four ounces
of candle wax per day, plus four more ounces if
it uses its belly lantern. A lantern dragonette’s
unusual diet leads it to lair in libraries, abbeys,
and other places of study. Even though the
dragonettes eat candles essential for study
during dark hours, they still provide light
and protect their adopted homes. Residents
and caretakers consider them good luck and
enjoy conversing with them.

**Telepathic Chatterbox.** This gregarious
drake prefers to speak with its companions
but uses telepathy if necessary, and the
creature hisses when surprised or displeased.
It loves nothing more than discussing magic and
history with an intelligent and informed individual.

**Adventurous Companions.** Occasionally, a
dragonette wishing to learn more about the world
finds a spellcaster or adventuring party to travel
with, purely for the sake of learning or to acquire new
sources of knowledge. Most parties enjoy the traveling
light source and the abilities these companions bring to bear. A
lantern dragonette avoids combat and uses its abilities only to
escape or to defend its lair, family, and friends.

A dragonette lives up to 30 years. A mated pair produces one
clutch of two to five eggs every five years, and one parent raises
the young dragonettes until they mature after a year and leave to
search for their own lairs. A cloister of lantern dragonettes taxes
their lair’s resources, so the other parent often ventures out to
retrieve more candles.
