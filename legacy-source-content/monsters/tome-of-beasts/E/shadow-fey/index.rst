Elves, Shadow Fey
-----------------

*“Kind words open even iron doors.”*

*—Twilight, a courtier to the shadow fey*

To most, the shadow fey are little more than a dancing shadow
among the leaves. To savants, they are the creatures that taught
the shadowdancers all they know, and kept many secrets to
themselves. They were once elves like all others, dwelling in
mortal lands beneath the sun. An ancient catastrophe drove
them to darkness, and now they are creatures of the shadow.
Though they can be found on the Material Plane, they are
inextricably tied to the plane of Shadows, and that is the seat of
their power and culture.

Shadow fey superficially resemble other elves, but they’re
rarely mistaken for their lighted cousins. Skin tones among
the shadow fey range from alabaster white to ebony black, with
varying shades of gray in between, but they are otherwise lacking
in color. A few have a scintillating shimmer to their skin. Many
shadow fey grow horns that sweep out from their hair, varying
in size from subtle nubs to obvious spikes. Others have shocking
sets of teeth.

**Dual Natured.** The shadow fey are contradictory beings. They
boast some of the best features of elves, tempered by aspects
of a fouler nature. They can be deliberate and purposeful, but
they’re also given to perplexing whimsy. Mortal creatures
trying to fathom shadow fey motivations are in for a maddening
experience; they are often illogical, capricious, and seemingly
thrive on annoying others.

**Split Rulership.** The Summer Court and Winter Court each
rule the shadow fey in the appropriate season. The turning of
these seasons follows no clear calendar or schedule, though it
is skewed toward summer. The Queen of Night and Magic and
the Moonlit King each claim dominion in turn, ruling over the
Summer and Winter courts respectively.

Other fey call them the Scáthsidhe (pronounced scAH-shee),
or shadow faeries, and they are usually counted among the
unseelie, though they would dispute that characterization. They
simply call themselves part of the sidhe, and consider themselves
an extension of the Seelie Court.

**The Reach of Darkness.** Their bond with darkness allows
the shadow fey to slip through distant spaces, traversing
darkness itself from one place to another. Not only can every
shadow fey slip from a shadow or patch of darkness to instantly
appear elsewhere, they also control the mysterious and powerful
shadow roads. Shadow roads are magical pathways that connect
points on the Material Plane by dipping through the plane of
shadow, allowing rapid and completely secret travel for the
fey—and more importantly, for their weapons of war, their trade
goods, and their allies.

The shadow fey all have an instinctive understanding of how a
shadow road functions, and they are adept at both operating the
entrance portals and navigating any hazards on the road. This
bond with darkness has a price, of course, and the shadow fey
shun the sun’s light.
