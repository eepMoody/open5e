Edimmu
------

*An evil wind swirls out of the desert, parching those it touches,
whispering evil plans. These winds are the edimmus.*

**Bitter Exiles.** Desert and plains tribes often exile their
criminals to wander as outcasts. A banished criminal who dies
of thirst sometimes rises as an edimmu, a hateful undead that
blames all sentient living beings for its fate.

**Rise Again.** Unless its body is found and given a proper
burial, an edimmu is nearly impossible to destroy. While
edimmus linger near their corpses, they often follow
prey they have cursed to seal the creature’s fate.
Once that creature is slain, they return to the site
of their demise.

**Undead Nature.** An edimmu doesn’t require
air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Rejuvenation.** If destroyed, an edimmu rises again in 2d4 days.
Permanently destroying one requires properly burying its
mortal remains in consecrated or hallowed ground. Edimmus
rarely venture more than a mile from the place of their death.

**Incorporeal Movement.** The edimmu can move through other
creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5
(1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Water Siphon.** *Melee Spell Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature. *Hit:* 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. The target must
succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point
maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage
taken and it is :ref:`srd:stunned` for 1 minute and gains one level of
:ref:`srd:exhaustion`. A stunned creature repeats the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, ending the stun on itself on a success.
The hit point reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long
rest and drinks abundant water or until it is affected by :ref:`srd:greater-restoration`
or comparable magic. The target dies if this effect
reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
