Eala
----

*This swanlike creature’s feathers are made of shining metal. When
it inhales, the feathers on its chest glow red hot.*

Eala are beautiful but deadly creatures native to
the plane of Shadow. They grow feathers like their Material
Plane counterparts, but their feathers are made of gleaming,
razor‑sharp metal.

**Metallic Diet.** Eala plumage displays a stunning mixture
of metallic colors, which vary depending on their diet. An eala
uses its fire breath to melt metals with low melting points such
as gold, silver, lead, copper, and bronze. The eala consumes the
molten metal, some of which migrates into the creature’s deadly
feathers. Eala that display primarily or entirely a single color are
highly prized.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The eala makes two
attacks with its wing blades.

**Wing Blades.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

**Fire Breath (recharge 5-6).**
The eala breathes fire in a
20-foot cone. Every creature
in the area must make a
DC 11 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire
damage on a failed save or
half as much on a successful one. The eala’s fire breath ignites
flammable objects and melts soft metals in the area that aren’t
being worn or carried.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Swan Song.** When the eala is reduced to 0 hit points, it can use
its last breath sing a plaintive and beautiful melody. Creatures
within 20 feet that can hear the eala must succeed on a DC
13 Charisma saving throw or be :ref:`srd:incapacitated` for 1 round. A
creature incapacitated in this way has its speed reduced to 0.
