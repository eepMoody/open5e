Eleinomae
---------

*Eleinomae, or marsh nymphs, are beautiful fey who hold sway over
many wetlands, from the chill to the tropical. They wear distinctive
dresses fashioned from reeds and water lilies.*

**Nets for Travelers.** Eleinomae are cruel and depraved
creatures that seduce travelers with charms and illusions, then
lead them to a watery grave. To capture their victims, eleinomae
weave a net from swamp reeds and grasses, and decorate
it with beautiful blossoms that release an intoxicating,
bewitching aroma.

**Aquatic Cemeteries.** They are known to keep the most
handsome captives as companions—for a time, at
least, but they invariably grow weary of their company
and drown them. Many eleinomae preserve the bodies
of previous mates in aquatic cemeteries where the corpses
float among fields of water lilies, and they spend much
time singing to the dead. Such watery graveyards are
often guarded by charmed allies of the eleinomae or
other caretakers.

**Vain Singers.** While eleinomae have few weaknesses, their
vanity and overconfidence can be exploited to vanquish them.
They are proud of their sweet voices and clever creation of songs
and harmonies.
