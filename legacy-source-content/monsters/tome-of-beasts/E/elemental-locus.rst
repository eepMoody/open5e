Elemental Locus
---------------

*The ground ripples and tears as rocks fall, jets of flame erupt, and
howling winds rage around an elemental locus. The land is angry.*

**Spirit of the Land.** Elemental loci are living spirits inhabiting
or embodying tracts of land and geographical features. They are
the ultimate personification of nature—the land itself come to
life—varying in size from small hills to entire ridge lines, with
no discernible pattern to where they take root.

**Stubborn Nature.** Elemental loci are fiercely protective
of their chosen location. They tolerate no interference in the
natural order and challenge all who despoil the land, be they
mortal, monster, or god.

**Elemental Nature.** An elemental locus doesn’t require air,
food, drink, or sleep.

**Magic Resistance.** The elemental locus has advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Immortal.** The elemental locus does not age and does not
die when it drops to 0 hit points. If the elemental locus
drops to 0 hit points, it falls into a quiescent state for 25
weeks before returning to activity with full hit points.
Its spawned elementals continue fighting
whatever enemies attacked the elemental
locus; if no enemies are present, they
defend the locus’s area.

**Massive.** The elemental locus is larger
than most Gargantuan creatures,
occupying a space of 60 by 60
feet. Its movement is not affected
by difficult terrain or by Huge or
smaller creatures. Other creatures
can enter and move through the
elemental locus’s space, but they
must make a successful DC 20 Strength
(Athletics) check after each 10 feet of movement. Failure
indicates they fall :ref:`srd:prone` and can move no farther that turn.

**Spawn Elementals.** As a bonus action, the elemental locus
loses 82 hit points and spawns an air, earth, fire, or water
elemental to serve it. Spawned elementals answer to their
creator’s will and are not fully independent. The types of
elementals the locus can spawn depend on the terrain it
embodies; for example, an elemental locus of the desert can
spawn earth, fire, and air elementals, but not water.

**Siege Monster.** The elemental locus deals double damage to
objects and structures.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack:** The elemental locus makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 36 (6d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a
creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or
be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`.
