Eonic Drifter
-------------

*The air crackles and lights flicker in the ruins. In a whirl of
colorful robes, the drifter materializes from the unfathomable
maelstroms of time. His eyes scan the hall in panic,
anticipating the terrible revelations of yet another era.*

**Adrift in Time.** Not much is known about the time
traveling eonic drifters other than that they left a dying
civilization to look for help not available in their own age.
To their misfortune, returning to their own time proved
much more difficult than leaving it, so the eonic drifters
found themselves adrift in the river of time. As the decades
passed, their chance of returning home withered, along with
the flesh of their bodies. They have been become mummified
by the passing ages.

**Crystal Belts.** A drifter carries an odd assembly of
gear gathered in countless centuries, proof of its tragic
journey. The more eclectic the collection, the more
jumps it has performed on its odyssey.

Belts of crystals around its body store the energy that
fuels a drifter’s travels. After each large jump through time,
the reservoirs are exhausted and can be used only for very
short jumps.

**Jittery and Paranoid.** Visiting countless eras in which
mankind has all but forgotten this once-great civilization has
robbed most eonic drifters of their sanity. Their greatest fear is
being robbed of their crystal belts. They plead or fight for them
as if their lives depended on them—which, in a sense, they do.

Adventurers who convince a drifter of their good intentions
may be asked for aid. In exchange, a drifter can offer long-lost
artifacts gathered from many forays through time.

Drifters can appear at any time or place, but they often
frequent the sites of their people’s past (or future) cities. There
they are comforted by knowing that they’re at least in the right
place, if not the right time.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The eonic drifter can either use Drift Backward or
make two attacks with its time warping staff. The eonic drifter’s
future self (if present) can only use Drift Forward.

**Time Warping Staff.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d10 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

**Drift Backward (1/Day).** A future self of the eonic drifter
materializes in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the drifter.
The future self has the eonic drifter’s stats and its full hit points,
and it takes its turn immediately after its present self. Killing
the original eonic drifter makes its future self disappear. If the
present self sees its future self die, the eonic drifter must make
a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. There is no effect if the save
succeeds. If the saving throw fails, roll 1d6 to determine the
effect on the eonic drifter: 1 = :ref:`srd:frightened`, 2 = :ref:`srd:incapacitated`,
3 = :ref:`srd:paralyzed`, 4 = :ref:`srd:unconscious`, 5 or 6 = has disadvantage on
attack rolls and ability checks. These effects last 1d4 rounds.

**Drift Forward (2/Day).** The future self makes a time warping
staff attack against a target. If the attack hits, instead of causing
bludgeoning damage, both the target and the attacker jump
forward through time, effectively ceasing to exist in the present
time. They reappear in the same locations 1d4 rounds later, at
the end of the present self’s turn. Creatures occupying those
locations at that moment are pushed 5 feet in a direction of
their own choosing. The target of the drift (but not the future
self) must then make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, with
effects identical to those for the eonic drifter witnessing the
death of its future self (see Drift Backward). The future self
doesn’t reappear after using this ability the second time; only
the target of the drift reappears from the second use. This does
not trigger a saving throw for the present self.
