Erina
-----

*This small humanoid has a slightly pointed face with bright, brown
eyes and a black, snout-like nose. Its skin is covered in short, tan
fur, and its head, shoulders, and back have smoothed-down quills.*

Erinas, or hedgehog folk, are a small, communal race.

**Burrowed Villages.** Natural diggers at heart, erinas live
in shallow networks of tunnels and chambers they excavate
themselves. Enemies who attack the peaceful erinas easily
become confused and lost in the mazelike tunnels. On their own
ground, the erinas can easily evade, outmaneuver, or surround
invaders. They often lure them onto choke points where the
enemy can be delayed endlessly while noncombatants and
valuables are hustled to safety through other tunnels.

**Scroungers and Gatherers.** Erinas are naturally curious.
They tend to explore an area by tunneling beneath it and popping
up at interesting points. They dislike farming, but subsist mainly
on the bounty of the land surrounding their homes. In cities,
they still subsist on what they can find, and they have a knack for
finding whatever they need. Sometimes they are called thieves,
but they arenâ€™t greedy or malicious. They take only what they
need, and seldom take anything from the poor. Some humans
even consider it lucky to have a family of erinas nearby.
