Eater of Dust
-------------

*This terrible creature resembles an imposing knight wearing
baroque plate armor made of calcified resin. Its helm is a blank
gray oval without eye slots or mouthpiece, and it carries a
glistening greatsword with one or more slavering, fanged mouths.*

Eaters of dust can consume just about anything with their
horrible animate mawblades, including most gems and metals,
but they prefer the flesh and souls of mortals to any other form
of payment.

**Mercenary Companies.** Eaters of dust—or yakat-shi as
they are sometimes called in ancient planar texts—roam
the lower planes selling their services to arch-devils,
demon lords, and other fiendish rulers for the chance
to sample new flavors and devour interesting
morsels. Eaters of dust often operate in small
but deadly military units led by a powerful
leader, styled the yakat-norog.

**Armor Shell.** While many sages confuse
eaters of dust for some obscure variety of fiend,
they are aberrations escaped from a far-flung
dimension of madness and nightmares. Indeed,
their armor is not armor at all, but a secreted resin that
hardens into a shell as strong as steel. When cracked,
it exudes a nacreous blood, and the resulting scar resembles
mother-of-pearl. Heavily scarred eaters of dust seem to have a
huge number of such mother-of-pearl inlays, but these are all
marks of wounds they have survived.

**Destroy Magic.** Eaters of dust take particular delight in
destroying and devouring powerful magical weapons and armor,
especially intelligent or holy weapons, and charge recklessly
into battle against opponents wielding such delicious viands.
They are have nothing but contempt for most other life forms,
attacking and eating their allies at the first sign of weakness.

A typical eater of dust is 7 feet tall and weighs more than 350
lb. While an eater of dust cannot speak, it can telepathically
communicate with almost any creature.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The eater of dust’s innate
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to
hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells,
requiring no material components:

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:freedom-of-movement`, :ref:`srd:inflict-wounds`, :ref:`srd:true-strike`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:cure-wounds` (as 3rd level), :ref:`srd:magic-weapon` (as 6th
level), :ref:`srd:misty-step`

**Regeneration.** The eater of dust regains 5 hit points at the start
of its turn. If it takes fire damage, this trait does not function at
the start of its next turn. The eater of dust dies only if it starts
its turn with 0 hit points and does not regenerate.

**Unending Hunger.** An eater of dust can devour any substance
with its mawblade, regardless of composition, and never get
full. It can even gain nourishment from eating dust or soil
(hence the name given to the race by various fiends). If an
eater of dust’s mawblade is ever stolen, lost, or destroyed, it
slowly starves to death.

**Weapon Bond.** A mawblade is part of the eater of dust. It
can strike any creature as if it were magically enchanted and
made of silver, iron, or other materials required to overcome
immunities or resistances. An eater of dust always knows the
location of its mawblade as if using the locate creature spell.
