Xanka
-----

*This small metallic globe skitters about on
many-jointed legs.*

**Cleaning Constructs.** Created
by gnomish tinkerers, xanka are
constructs whose purpose is cleaning
up their masters’ messy workshops.
Most xanka are built from copper,
brass, or bronze, but gold, silver,
and platinum varieties have been
seen in the houses of nobles and
rich merchants.

Xanka are not built for
fighting—their instinct tells them
to skitter for cover when danger
threatens—but they will defend
themselves when cornered.

**Follow Commands.** These
constructs only obey simple
commands that relate to
the removal of garbage.
They communicate with
each other, but how they do it
is unknown.

**Absorb Matter.** When a
xanka touches matter with its
globular body, it absorbs that
matter into itself and breaks it
down into energy, so that it
can seek out more matter to
absorb. Gnomes use them
to keep the halls and streets
clear of refuse. Xanka can
absorb matter equaling half their
body size every 6 seconds, but all this absorbing and converting
doesn’t alter the xanka’s size.

**Constructed Nature.** Xanka do not require air, food, drink, or
sleep.

**Ingest Weapons.** When the xanka is hit by a melee weapon
and the final, adjusted attack roll is 19 or less, the weapon
gains a permanent –1 penalty to damage rolls, after inflicting
damage for this attack. If the penalty reaches –5, the weapon is
destroyed. Even magic weapons are subject to this effect.

**Magic Weapons.** The xanka’s weapon attacks are magical.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Absorb.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 6 (1d8 + 2) force damage, and the xanka regains hit points
equal to the damage caused by its attack. In addition, a living
creature hit by this attack must make a successful DC 12
Dexterity saving throw or suffer a gaping wound that causes
2 (1d4) necrotic damage at the end of each of the creature’s
turns until the wound is treated with magical healing or with
a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Medicine) check. If a creature
who fails this saving throw is wearing armor or using a shield,
the creature can choose to prevent the necrotic damage
by permanently reducing the AC of its armor or shield by 1
instead.
