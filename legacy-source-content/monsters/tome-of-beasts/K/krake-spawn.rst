Krake Spawn
-----------

*This twisted, unnatural beast looks like the unholy union of
squid and spider. Its shell-covered core has six small rubbery legs,
peculiar antennae, and six tentacles around a squid’s enormous
beak. Unlike krakens and giant squid, krake spawn can scuttle
onto land.*

**Demonic Crossbreeds.** Some believe krake spawn are
demonic crossbreeds created by the aboleth, fusing kraken
blood with demonic souls. Others say that krake spawn are the
horrible creation of a long-forgotten meddling god, summoned
to the mortal world by deep ones. Certainly krake spawn do
respond to summoning magic, and sorcerers do summon
krake spawn through blood sacrifices to work evil in the world.
However, they do so at considerable peril: unlike demons and
devils, krake spawn are seldom bound by pacts of any kind.

**Outwit Humans.** Though enormous and carrying an armored
green shell on their six spindly legs, krake spawn are surprisingly
quick and agile. Worse, they have a malicious and bloodthirsty
intellect. A krake spawn is considerably smarter than most
humans, who mistake them for dumb beasts—an error that can
often prove fatal.

**Iceberg Fortresses.** Krake spawn live in remote, icy regions,
where they fashion elaborate iceberg fortresses. When they
venture into warmer climes in search of magic or slaves, they
can preserve their icebergs with ice storms. These fortresses are
stocked with frozen creatures (an emergency food supply), the
krake spawn’s treasure and library, slaves or prisoners of many
races, and a hellish nest filled with the krake spawn’s offspring.
A krake spawn measures 40 feet in length and weighs 2,000 lb.

**Amphibious.** The krake spawn can breathe air and water.

**Jet.** While underwater, the krake spawn can take the withdraw
action to jet backward at a speed of 140 feet. It must move in a
straight line while using this ability.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The krake spawn’s innate spellcasting
ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:protection-from-energy`, :ref:`srd:ray-of-frost`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:ice-storm`, :ref:`srd:wall-of-ice`

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The krake spawn makes eight tentacle attacks and
one bite attack. It can subsitute one constrict attack for two
tentacle attacks if it has a creature grappled at the start of its
turn, but it never constricts more than once per turn.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 10 ft, one target.
*Hit:* 12 (1d10 + 7) slashing damage.

**Tentacle.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 10 (1d6 + 7) necrotic damage. If two tentacle
attacks hit the same target in one turn, the target is also
:ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 17).

**Constrict.** The constricted creature takes 26 (3d12 + 7)
bludgeoning damage and is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 17) and
:ref:`srd:restrained`.

**Ink Cloud (Recharge 6).** The krake spawn emits black,
venomous ink in a 30-foot cloud as a bonus action while
underwater. The cloud affects vision as the :ref:`srd:darkness`
spell, and any creature that starts its turn inside
the cloud takes 10 (3d6) poison damage, or half
damage with a successful DC 18 Constitution
saving throw. The krake spawn’s darkvision
is not impaired by this cloud. The cloud
persists for 1 minute, then disperses.

**Vomit Forth the Deeps (1/Day).**
The krake spawn sprays
half‑digested food from
its maw over a 15‑foot
cone. This acidic slurry
causes 3 (1d6) acid
damage and targets must
make a successful DC 18
Constitution saving throw
or be :ref:`srd:incapacitated`
until the end of
their next turn.
