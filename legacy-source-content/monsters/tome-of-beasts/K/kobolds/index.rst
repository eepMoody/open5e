Kobolds
-------

More than anything, kobolds are survivors. Their scaly skin and
keen night vision as well as their dextrous claws and sensitive
snouts make them quick to sense danger, and their clawed feet
move them out of danger with cowardly speed. They are small
but fierce when fighting on their own terms, and their weight
of numbers helps them survive in places where larger but less
numerous races can’t sustain a settlement. Kobolds are great
miners, good gearsmiths, and modest alchemists, and they have a
curiosity about the world that frequently gets them into trouble.

**Underworld Merchants.** Kobolds are merchants to both
the surface world and the world beneath it, with their greatest
cities hidden deep below the earth. Their enemies are the
diabolical gnomes, the dwarves, and any other mining races that
seek dominance of dark, rich territories.

Kobolds are closely allied with and related to dragonborn,
drakes, and dragons. The kobold kings (and there are oh‑so‑many
kobold kings, since no kobold ruler is satisfied with being merely
a chieftain) admire dragons as the greatest sources of wisdom,
power, and proper behavior.
