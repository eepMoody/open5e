Kobold Chieftain
----------------

*This small, draconic humanoid struts as though it were ten feet tall.
It wears the gilded skull of a small dragon as a helmet, and its beady
eyes gleam out through the skull’s sockets. It hefts its spear and
shield and lets out a blood-curdling shriek, signaling the attack.*

While most kobolds are scuttling scavengers or pathetic
sycophants, a few carry a spark of draconic nobility that can’t be
ignored. These few forge their tribes into forces to be reckoned
with, rising to the rank of chieftain. A kobold chieftain stands
proud, clad in war gear of fine quality and good repair. Their
weapons are tended by the tribe’s trapsmiths, particularly
evident in their springspike shields.

**Living Legend.** A kobold chieftain is more than a leader, it is
a symbol of the tribe’s greatness. The strongest, most cunning,
most ruthless of a kobold tribe embodies their connection to the
revered dragons. When a chieftain sounds the call to battle, the
kobolds meld into a fearless, deadly force.
