Kobold Alchemist
----------------

*This slight, reptilian humanoid is bedecked with ceramic flasks
and glass vials. An acrid reek follows in the creature’s wake.*

Kobold alchemists are usually smelled before they
are seen, thanks to the apothecary’s store of chemicals
and poisons they carry. Alchemists often sport
mottled and discolored scales and skin, caused by
the caustic nature of their obsessions. They raid
alchemy shops and magical laboratories to
gather more material to fuel their reckless
experiments.

**Dangerous Assets.** Alchemists can be a
great boon to their clan, but at a cost. Not only
do the alchemists require rare, expensive,
and often dangerous substances to ply their
trade, they tend to be a little unhinged. Their
experiments yield powerful weapons and
defensive concoctions that can save many
kobold lives, but the destruction caused by an
experiment gone awry can be terrible.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The kobold makes two attacks.

**Dagger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) poison damage.

**Dart.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) poison
damage.

*Alchemical Protection (Recharge after a Short or Long Rest).*
The kobold chooses up to six allied creatures within 10 feet. It
releases alchemical vapors that grant those allies resistance to
poison damage for 10 minutes. Instead of poison damage, the
kobold can grant resistance to the damage type currently in
effect for its Apothecary trait.

**Explosive Flask (Recharge 5-6).** The kobold throws a flask of
volatile substances at a point within 30 feet. The flask explodes
in a 15-foot radius. Creatures in the area take 17 (5d6) poison
damage and are :ref:`srd:poisoned` for 1 minute, or take half damage
and are not poisoned with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving
throw. A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, ending the poisoned condition on a
success. Instead of poison damage, the kobold can deal the
damage type currently in effect for its Apothecary trait.
