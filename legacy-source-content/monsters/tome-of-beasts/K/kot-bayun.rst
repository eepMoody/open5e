Kot Bayun
---------

*This oddly colored cat appears at first to be a powerful
panther. Its wide mouth pulls into something like
a human grin, and its knowing eyes
hint at intelligence beyond that of a
typical predator.*

Enemies of elves and blink dogs, kot
bayuns are magical hunting cats gifted
with eloquent speech and cunning
abilities.

**Speaking Fey Cats.** These brutal and
temperamental creatures get along well
with cruel-minded fey. More gentle
fey rightfully find the creatures to be
a menace. A kot bayun measures six
feet long and weighs over 200 lb.
They are long-lived, and some stories
record the same kot bayun in a region
for over 400 years.

**Sing to Sleep.** In addition to
their stealthy natures and physical
prowess, kot bayun have the
ability to put prey to sleep with
song. They carefully choose
victims and stalk them for a
time, learning their strengths
and weaknesses before making
their attack. They lay in wait
until their prey is vulnerable and then begin their slumbering
song. Those resisting the call to slumber are always the kot
bayun’s first victims as they launch from cover and attempt
to disembowel their prey. In forests with a thick canopy, a
kot bayun stealthily creeps among tree limbs, tracking the
movement of its prey below.

**Healing Poetry.** If discovered by intelligent prey, a kot bayun
opens with a parley instead of claws. In rare cases, a kot bayun
finds something in its prey it likes and cold predation turns to a
lukewarm association.

Befriending a kot bayun has benefits as the creature’s poems,
tales, and sagas have the magical ability to heal negative
conditions. A kot bayun tells its stories in the form of strange
epics and poetry, ranging from simple rhyming folk poems to
complex sonnets. This ability is not widely known (a secret the
creatures intend to keep), but, as folktales spread, more and
more adventurers and sages seek out these elusive beasts.

**Folk Cure.** A kot bayun’s tales have the effect of a :ref:`srd:lesser-restoration`
spell at will, and once per week it can have the
effect of :ref:`srd:greater-restoration`. The kot bayun designates one
listener to benefit from its ability, and that listener must spend
one uninterrupted hour listening to the cat’s tales. Kot bayuns
are reluctant to share this benefit and must be bargained with
or under the effect of domination to grant the boon.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The kot bayun’s innate spellcasting ability
is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:fog-cloud`, :ref:`srd:invisibility` (self only)

**1/day:** :ref:`srd:blink`

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The kot bayun makes one bite attack and one
claws attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

**Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5ft., one target.
*Hit:* 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage.

**Slumbering Song.** The kot bayun puts creatures to sleep with
its haunting melody. While a kot bayun sings, it can target one
hearing creature within a 100-foot radius. This target must
succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or fall asleep. The
target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success. Each round the kot
bayun maintains its song, it can select a new target. A creature
that successfully saves is immune to the effect of that kot
bayun’s song for 24 hours. The slumbering song even affects
elves, but they have advantage on the Charisma saving throw.
