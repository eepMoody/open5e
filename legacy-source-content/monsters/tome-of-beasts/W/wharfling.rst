Wharfling
---------

*Hairless, ugly, and usually dripping water, the wharfling is
a nocturnal raider and fond of stealing from fishmongers and
jewelers alike.*

**Waterborne Packs.** Wharflings have large, webbed
hands and feet and oversized mouths. An adept fish
catcher, wharflings establish dens near the shores of
oceans, lakes, and rivers, and they often move in
family groups of 3 or more.

**Thieving Gits.** Those who have been bitten by
a wharfling rightly fear their needle-like teeth, but
most coastal communities hate the animal more
for its propensity for theft. Their lairs are invariably filled with
stolen metal trinkets.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the target is :ref:`srd:grappled`
(escape DC 10). Until this grapple ends, the wharfling can’t use
its bite on another target. While the target is grappled, the
wharfling’s bite attack hits it automatically.

**Pilfer.** A wharfling that has an opponent grappled at the start
of its turn can make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check as
a bonus action. The DC for this check equals 10 plus the
grappled target’s Dexterity modifier. If the check is successful,
the wharfling steals some small metallic object from the target,
and the theft is unnoticed if the same result equals or exceeds
the target’s passive Perception. A wharfling flees with its
treasure.
