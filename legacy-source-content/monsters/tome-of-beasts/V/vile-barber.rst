Vile Barber (Siabhra)
---------------------

*A pale, scrawny fellow clad in a black leather apron and slender
ebon gloves grins from the shadows. A maw of needle-sharp teeth
and the wicked straight razor at his side are a clear warning that
his enemies should hasten their footsteps.*

Vile barbers are sadistic, unseelie fey who move through the
shadows to execute their bloody, malevolent wills. Known as
barbers for both the use of wicked blades and their proclivity
for slashing the necks of their victims, these insidious fey can be
found lurking in dark and harrowed places like back-alley streets
or abandoned, deep-shaded cemeteries.

**Fey Punishers.** Called the siabhra (pronounced she-uvh-ra)
among the fey courts, vile barbers are fickle creatures. They are
sent to punish those who have offended the fey lords and ladies,
and their cruelty and cunning help them write messages in blood
and skin. At the very least, they scar those who have spoken ill
of the fey; those who have harmed or murdered the fey are more
likely to be bled slowly. Some of these deaths are made quite
public—though in a few cases, the victim is enchanted to remain
invisible while the siabhra does its bloody work.

**Slippery Fighters.** A vile barber often uses its ability to step
through shadows to steal a victim’s weapon and use it against its
former owner with devastating effect. Any creature grappled by
a vile barber is at the mercy of the barber’s sinister and unclean
weapons—they delight in close combat.

**Assassins and Envoys.** Vile barbers frequently consort with
hags and prowl the places these wicked crones cannot go as
emissaries and assassins. Some sages speculate that vile barbers
are envoys of the Queen of Night and Magic or the Queen of
Witches. Information on the siabhra is scant; most adventurers
who meet them don’t live to share their findings or to see the vile
barber lick its bloody blade clean.
