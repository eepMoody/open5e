Tendril Puppet
--------------

*Moving in odd starts and jerks, these vegetal warriors have thin,
green vines growing out from their empty eye sockets, mouth, and
ears, and twining around their head, chest, and arms.*

Any beast or humanoid can become a tendril puppet if infected
by a vine lord.

**Plant Sentries.** Tendril puppets mindlessly attack creatures
that threaten their forest or jungle. They have no sense of self
preservation and always fight to the death.

**Poor Vision.** Tendril puppets see almost nothing beyond 30
feet away.

**Root Mind.** All tendril puppets are connected through a
shared consciousness called the root mind; if one tendril puppet
is aware of danger, all tendril puppets are aware of it. This
includes recognizing foes who slew other tendril puppets or
who are wanted by a vine lord, druid, or duskthorn dryad who
commands them.
