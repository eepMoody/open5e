Vættir
-------

*Vættir are ancestral spirits, sometimes protective and helpful but
demanding reverence and wrathful when offended.*

**Servants of the Land.** Land vættir dwell in barrows while sea
vættir live beneath lakes, rivers, or the sea—both wear ancient
mail and carry bronzes axes in withered hands. Servants of the
land, they haunt those who disrespect the wild or ancient laws
and traditions.

**Jealous and Wrathful.** A wrathful vættir rises from its
mound when its grave goods are stolen (including heirlooms
passed on to living descendants) or when they are disrespected
(leaving the dragon prow attached to a longship is a common
offense, as is failing to make offerings). Vættir jealously guard
both honor and treasures, and may be relentless enemies over
matters as small as an accidental word or a single coin.

**Dangerous Helpers.** A vættir’s blue-black skin is stretched
taut over its bones and sinews and its lips are drawn back in a
cruel grimace. A rarer, bone-white variety exists that cares little
for material possessions, instead guarding their honor or a
particular patch of land. Both varieties will answer a summons
by descendants or nearby villages. The summoned vættir will
wander into longhouses or taverns and sit down beside those
who call them, ready to serve. However, there’s always a price
and a vættir’s help is often more than bargained for.

**Undead Nature.** A vaettir doesn’t require air, food, drink,
or sleep.

**Covetous Bond.** Corpse-black vættir can see the face of any
creature holding or carrying any item the vættir ever claimed
as its own. It also detects the direction and distance to items
it ever owned, so long as that item is currently owned by
another. If the item changes hands, the new owner becomes
the target of the vættir’s hunt. Bone-white vættir see individuals
who have offended them. Neither time nor distance affects
these abilities, so long as both parties are on the same plane.

**Deathless.** The vættir is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit
points, but it returns to unlife where it fell on the next nightfall
with full hit points. It can be killed only by removing its head,
burning the corpse, and dumping the ashes in the sea, or
by returning it to its burial mound, placing an open pair of
scissors on its chest, and driving pins through its feet.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The vættir’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**2/day each:** :ref:`srd:gaseous-form`, :ref:`srd:hunters-mark`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:enlarge-reduce`, :ref:`srd:phantom-steed`

**1/week:** :ref:`srd:bestow-curse`, :ref:`srd:geas`, :ref:`srd:remove-curse`

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** Vættir avoid daylight. A vættir in direct
sunlight has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

**Multiattack.** The vættir makes two greataxe attacks or two
longbow attacks.

**Greataxe.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one

**Corpse Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The vættir spews forth a
15‑foot cone of putrid gas. Those caught in the area must
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become
:ref:`srd:poisoned` for 1d4 rounds.

**Maddening Gaze (1/Day).** The vættir can lock eyes with a
creature and drive it mad. Any creature within 30 feet of a
vættir that is the focus of its gaze must make a DC 12 Charisma

If the save is successful, the target is immune to the effect for
24 hours.
