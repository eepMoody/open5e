Miremal
-------

*The creature emerging from the shadows of the swamp is short and
lean. Its pale-skinned body is covered in fungus and moss that seems
to grow directly in its flesh, and its green eyes weep bloody tears.*

Miremals are savage, degenerate fey who delight in crafting
seemingly safe paths through treacherous swamps—though
these paths are, instead, riddled with traps and ambush points.

**Unreliable Guides.** Miremals hunt in packs of three to six
and often serve a more powerful creature, especially one that
commands potent magic. As a result, many of these paths lead
unwary travelers into the grove of a green hag coven or into the
lair of a black dragon.

**Swamp.** Miremals have adapted from sylvan forests to the
swamps: patches of red and green fungus sprout from their skin,
mushrooms and branches grow haphazardly out of their bodies,
and moss hangs from beneath their arms. Their eyes are forest
green and are perpetually wet with bloody tears—their legends
say their tears come from rage over their banishment and agony
from knowing they can never return.

**Hate Moss Lurkers.** Miremals are occasionally confused
with :ref:`miss lurkers <tob:moss-lurker>`, but the two despise one another and both
consider the comparison odious.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The miremal makes two attacks, one of which
must be a claw attack.

**Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

**Bog Spew (Recharge 5-6).** The miremal spews a noxious stream
of bog filth mixed with stomach acid at a target up to 20 feet
away. Target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving
throw or be :ref:`srd:blinded` for 1d4 rounds.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Muddled Escape (1/Day).** If an attack would reduce the
miremal’s hit points to 0, it collapses into a pool of filth-laden
swamp water and its hit points are reduced to 1 instead. The
miremal can move at its normal speed in this form, including
moving through spaces occupied by other creatures. As a
bonus action at the beginning of the miremal’s next turn, it can
reform, still with 1 hit point.
