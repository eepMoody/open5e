Mordant Snare
-------------

*Mordant snares were created by war mages of ancient times.
Each resembles an immense, dark gray, 11-armed starfish
weighing eight tons, and yet a mordant snare is never
obvious. Instead, it controls a few humanoids shuffling
about aimlessly, their skin glistening with moisture,
occasionally forming loose groups near the snare. These puppets
pay little attention to their surroundings.*

**Starfish Puppet Masters.** Snares bury themselves under
loose soil to attack creatures walking above them. They attack by
extruding filaments that inject acid into victims; this liquefies
organs and muscle while leaving the skeleton, tendons, and
skin intact. With the body thus hollowed out and refilled
with acid and filaments, the mordant snare can control
it from below like a puppet, creating a group of awkward,
disoriented people. New victims fall prey to mordant snares
when they approach to investigate.

**Brains Preferred.** The mordant snare prefers intelligent
food. With its tremorsense, it can easily distinguish between
prey; it prefers Small and Medium bipeds. A mordant snare
hunts an area until it is empty, so a village can suffer tremendous
losses or even be wiped out before discovering what’s
happening. However, a mordant snare is intelligent enough to
know that escaped victims may come back with friends, shovels,
and weapons, ready for battle. When this occurs, the snare
abandons its puppets, burrows deeper underground, and seeks
a new home.

**Cooperative Killers.** Mordant snares are few in number
and cannot reproduce. Since the secret of their creation was lost
long ago, eventually they will disappear forever—until then, they
cooperate well with each other, using puppets to lure victims to
one another. A team is much more dangerous than a lone snare,
and when three or more link up, they are especially deadly.

**Magic Resistance.** The mordant snare has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Absorb Channeled Energy.** If a mordant snare is in the area
of effect of a turn undead attempt, it gains temporary hit
points. For each
mordant puppet
that would have
been affected
by the turning if it were a zombie, the mordant snare gains 10
temporary hit points, to a maximum of 60.

**Buried.** Until it does something to reveal its presence, a buried
mordant snare is treated as if it’s :ref:`srd:invisible`.

**Mordant Puppets.** A mordant snare can control up to four
bodies per tentacle. These “puppets” look and move like
zombies. Treat each one as a :ref:`srd:zombie`, but limited in movement
to the 30-foot-by-30-foot area above the buried snare. Unlike
normal zombies, any creature within 5 feet of a mordant
puppet when the puppet takes piercing or slashing damage
takes 3 (1d6) acid damage (spray from the wound). All puppets
attached to a particular tentacle are destroyed if the mordant
snare attacks with that tentacle; this does 9 (2d8) acid damage
per puppet to all creatures within 5 feet of any of those
puppets, or half damage with a successful DC 16 Dexterity
saving throw. Damage done to puppet zombies doesn’t affect
the mordant snare. If the snare is killed, all of its puppets die
immediately without causing any acid damage.
