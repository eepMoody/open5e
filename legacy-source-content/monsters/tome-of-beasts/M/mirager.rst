Mirager
-------

*This lovely lass is clad in diaphanous veils and a revealing skirt,
and she shows graceful skill while dancing through the dust.*

**Humanoid Sand.** In its natural form, a mirager resembles a
shifting mass of sand and dust with a vaguely humanoid shape,
crumbling away like a sandcastle in the wind.

**Enticing Illusion.** A mirage can take on the guise of a lovely
man or woman with luminous eyes, delicate features, and
seductive garments. Whether male or female, a mirager dresses
in veils and flowing robes that accentuate its enticing beauty.

**Thirst for Blood.** Whatever its apparent form, a mirager’s
existence is one of unnatural and endless thirst. They hunger for
flesh and thirst for blood, and they draw especial pleasure from
leeching a creature’s fluids in the throes of passion. A victim
is drained into a lifeless husk before the mirager feasts on the
dehydrated remains.

**Shapechanger.** The mirager can use its action to polymorph
into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form.
Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any
equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts
to its true form if it dies.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The mirager’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**3/day:** :ref:`srd:charm-person`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:hallucinatory-terrain`, :ref:`srd:suggestion`

**Enthralling Mirage.** When the mirager casts :ref:`srd:hallucinatory-terrain`,
the area appears so lush and inviting that those who
view it feel compelled to visit. Any creature that approaches
within 120 feet of the terrain must make a DC 15 Wisdom
saving throw. Those that fail are affected as by the :ref:`srd:enthrall`
spell with the mirager as the caster; they give the mirage their
undivided attention, wanting only to explore it, marvel at its
beauty, and rest there for an hour. The mirager can choose
to have creatures focus their attention on it instead of the
hallucinatory terrain. Creatures affected by the enthrall effect
automatically fail saving throws to disbelieve the hallucinatory
terrain. This effect ends if the hallucinatory terrain is dispelled.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack:** The mirager makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.

**Thirst Kiss.** The mirager feeds on the body moisture
of creatures it lures into kissing it. A creature must be
charmed, grappled, or incapacitated to be kissed. A kiss hits
automatically, does 21 (6d6) necrotic damage, and fills the
mirager with an exultant rush of euphoria that has the same
effect as a :ref:`srd:heroism` spell lasting 1 minute. The creature that
was kissed doesn’t notice that it took damage from the kiss
unless it makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Captivating Dance (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest,
Humanoid Form Only).** The mirager performs a sinuously
swaying dance. Humanoids within 20 feet that view this dance
must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be
:ref:`srd:stunned` for 1d4 rounds
and :ref:`srd:charmed` by
the mirager
for 1 minute.
Humanoids of
all races and
genders have
disadvantage on
this saving throw.
A creature that saves
successfully is immune
to this mirager’s
dance for the next
24 hours.
