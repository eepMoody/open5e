Mahoru
------

*“I saw no more terrible beast on all my journeys north than the mahoru.
The white bears had their aloof majesty, the lindwurm serpentine grace,
but the monster that gnawed away the pack ice beneath our feet and
savaged any who fell into the water was a thing of nightmare. The men it
snatched were torn apart, like rags in the mouth of a rabid dog.”*

A hybrid of fish and mammal, a mahoru is eight feet long and
looks like a small orca with a serpentine neck and seal-like head.

**Valuable Teeth and Fur.** Their heavy jaws are filled with
triangular, serrated teeth adept at tearing flesh and
sundering bone. Their white and black fur is highly
prized for its warmth and waterproof qualities.
Their pectoral fins feature stubby, claw-tipped
paws. Skraeling use the mahoru’s fangs to
make arrowheads or tooth-studded clubs,
and the mahoru is a totem beast for
many northern tribes.

**Iceberg Hunters.** Relatives of
the bunyip, mahoru prowl northern
coasts and estuaries, hunting among
the fragmenting pack ice each summer.
They lurk beneath the surface, catching
swimmers chunks or lurching up onto
the ice to break or tilt it and send prey
tumbling into the water. When necessary,
they stalk beaches and riverbanks in search
of carrion or unwary victims.

**Work in Pairs and Packs.** Mahoru work together in mated
pairs to corral everything from fish and seals to larger prey
like kayaking humans and even polar bears. They gnaw at ice
bridges and the frozen surface of lakes and rivers to create fragile
patches that plunge unwary victims into their waiting jaws.
