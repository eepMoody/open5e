Mamura
------

*This tiny monstrosity combines the worst elements of a dead frog
and a rotting fish. Its slimy, scaly, vaguely humanoid form has
three clawed arms arranged radially about its body. Its slimy green
bat‑like wings seem too small to work, yet it flies very well.*

**Twisted Field Sprites.** Mamuras are the twisted faeries of
magical wastelands and barren plains. They were once good-aligned,
pixie-like fey called “polevoi,” or “field sprites,” but at
some point they swore their souls to a dark goddess and were
corrupted by her foul magic. Now they are twisted, alien things.

**Cross-Dimensional.** The mamura is one degree out of
phase with the usual five dimensions. As a result, it always
appears blurry and indistinct even in bright light, and it seems
translucent in dim light.

Mamuras babble constantly, but their talk is mostly nonsense.
Their minds operate in multiple dimensions in time as well as
space, and this allows them to talk to creatures of the Realms
Beyond. Because of this, their babble may be prophetic, but only
few can decipher it.

**Prophetic Followers.** They occasionally align themselves
with powerful goblin tribes or evil wasteland sorcerers for their
own unknowable purposes.

**All-Around Vision.** Attackers never gain advantage on attacks
or bonus damage against a mamura from the presence of
nearby allies.

**Magic Resistance.** The mamura has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Friend to Darkness.** In darkness or dim light, the mamura has
advantage on Stealth checks. It can attempt to hide as a bonus
action at the end of its turn if it’s in dim light or darkness.

**Distraction.** Because of the mamura’s alien and forbidding
aura, any spellcaster within 20 feet of the mamura must make
a successful DC 14 spellcasting check before casting a spell;
if the check fails, they lose their action but not the spell slot.
They must also make a successful DC 14 spellcasting check
to maintain concentration if they spend any part of their turn
inside the aura.

**Flyby.** The mamura doesn’t provoke an opportunity attack
when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack:** The mamura makes three claw attacks and one
whiptail sting attack.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage, and the target must succeed
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be :ref:`srd:poisoned` for 1
round. The poison duration is cumulative with multiple failed
saving throws.

**Whiptail Stinger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 5 ft.,
one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take
1d6 poison damage. If the target is also poisoned by the
mamura’s claws, it takes another 1d6 poison damage at the
start of each of its turns while the poisoning remains in effect.
