Morphoi
-------

*These blue-skinned humanoids wield tridents and have unusual
faces with vertical eyes but no mouth or nose.*

**Shapeshifter Plants.** Morphoi are shape-shifting plant
creatures indigenous to many islands. In their natural forms, the
morphoi are androgynous beings between 5 and 6 feet tall. Their
elliptical heads have eyes on both front and back. When harmed,
they bleed a dark red sap.

As plants, the morphoi don’t need to eat. Instead, they gather
nutrients from the sun and air. When posing as humanoids, they
consume small amounts of food to aid their disguise, but since
they have no internal digestive system, the food is just stored
inside their bodies until they can spit it out.

**Ship Travel.** Morphoi live in island communities and in
nearby waters. Many travel by ship—usually by posing as
beautiful women, handsome men, or stranded travelers. They
harbor a powerful animosity toward intelligent animal life, and
their disguised agents are behind many otherwise inexplicable
acts of sabotage and murder.

Unlike doppelgangers, morphoi can’t mimic specific
individuals or read thoughts. Instead, they create intriguing
backgrounds to go along with their disguises.

**Four Eyes Always.** No matter what form they shift into,
morphoi always have four eyes, never two. They can relocate
their eyes to anywhere on their bodies, however, and they
try to keep the second pair of eyes on the back of the head
or neck (concealed by long hair or a tall collar), or the backs
of the hands (under gloves but useful to peer around corners).

About one in 30 morphoi are chieftains, and they have
rangers, shamans, and warlocks among them. Those chosen as
infiltrators are often rogues or bards. Stories tell of shapeshifted
morphoi falling in love with humans, but it is impossible for the
two species to interbreed.
