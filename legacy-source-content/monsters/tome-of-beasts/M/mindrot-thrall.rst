Mindrot Thrall
--------------

*A heavily cloaked figure reeks of decay and spreads a floating cloud
of spores with every step.*

**Fungal Rot.** Mindrot fungus is an intelligent hive-mind
parasite that consumes creatures from the inside out.
When inhaled, mindrot spores enter the brain through the
bloodstream. As the fungus grows, it dissolves the host’s body
and slowly replaces the creature’s flesh with its own.

The fungus’s first target is the motor function of the brain.
It takes control of the creature’s movement while the victim is
still alive and fully conscious—but no longer controls his or her
own body! Indeed, sensory awareness may be the last function
that the fungus attacks. Eventually, even the victim’s skin and
muscle are replaced with fungal fibers. At that point, the affected
creature no longer looks like its former self. Such a newly-born
mindrot thrall conceals its alarming appearance under heavy
robes or cloaks so it can travel without causing alarm.

**Spore Blisters.** A thrall’s skin is taut and waxy. Blisters form
just beneath the surface, and when they grow as large as a child’s
fist they burst, releasing a spray of spores. It seeks to infect
as many new victims as possible during the few weeks that it
survives in humanoid form. At the end of that time, the thrall
shrivels to a dried, vaguely humanoid husk. Even a dead mindrot
thrall, however, is still dangerous because its half-formed
spore blisters can remain infectious for months. Disturbing
the husk can burst these blisters and trigger a Mindrot
Spores attack.

**Dimensional Horrors.** Wizards hypothesize the
fungus was brought to the mortal world by a shambling
horror crossing through a dimensional portal. The
remoteness of that wasteland is likely whythe mindrot fungus
hasn’t destroyed whole cities, though someday it may find a
more fertile breeding ground.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The mindrot thrall makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage.

**Acid Breath (Recharge 4-6).** The thrall exhales a blast of acidic
spores from its rotten lungs in a 15-foot cone. Each creature
in that area takes 36 (8d8) acid damage, or half damage with
a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw
fails, the creature is also infected with mindrot spores.

**Mindrot Spores.** Infection occurs when mindrot spores are
inhaled or swallowed. Infected creatures must make a DC
13 Constitution saving throw at the end of every long rest;
nothing happens if the saving throw succeeds, but if it fails, the
creature takes 9 (2d8) acid damage and its hit point maximum
is reduced by the same amount. The infection ends when the
character makes successful saving throws after two consecutive
long rests, or receives the benefits of a :ref:`srd:lesser-restoration` spell
or comparable magic. A creature slain by this disease becomes
a mindrot thrall after 24 hours unless the corpse is destroyed.
