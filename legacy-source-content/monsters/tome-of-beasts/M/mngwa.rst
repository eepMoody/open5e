Mngwa
-----

*Tiny wisps of grayish smoke ooze from the slate-colored coat of this
leonine beast.*

**Ethereal Lions.** The elusive mngwa (MING-wah; “the
strange ones”) are the offspring of a sentient feline beast from
the Ethereal Plane that mated with a lioness long ago. Also
called nunda (“smoke-cats”), mngwas are strong and cunning
hunters that can elude pursuit or approach their prey unnoticed
by disappearing into the ether for a brief time.

**Rocky Terrain.** Mngwas choose their hunting ground
carefully, avoiding flatlands where competing predators are
plentiful. They favor rocky and treacherous terrain where their
talent for dancing along the veil between worlds allows them to
easily outmaneuver their prey.

**Feline Allies.** The strongest mngwa recruit other great cats
into their prides, though these associations tend to be short-lived.
They hunt with especially savage groups of nkosi, though
only a great pridelord can command one during a hunt. When
the hunt is over, the mngwa move on, and sometimes they take
one of the young nkosi with them to become a shaman.
