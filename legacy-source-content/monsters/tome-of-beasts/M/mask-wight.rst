Mask Wight
----------

*The frame of this withered demon’s corpse barely fills the ash-colored
plate armor that encases it. It carries a serrated khopesh sword in
spiked gauntlets that hiss with violet smoke, and a horned ivory
mask devoid of features is nailed to its face.*

**Children of Fiends.** Long ago, a demon lord of shadow
and deceit fell in love with a demon goddess of destruction. At
the base of a crater left by a meteor that destroyed a civilization,
the two devised a plan to not merely slay their peers, but wholly
expunge them from time itself, leaving only each other. Shortly
thereafter, the mask wights were conceived.

**Rites of Annihilation.** To create these undead, the lord
of shadows stole the bodies of death knights from beneath the
necropolis of an arch-lich. Then, the goddess of the underworld
sacrificed a million condemned souls and drained their essence
into ivory masks—one for each fiend the couple sought to
annihilate. Finally, the masks were hammered onto the knights
with cold iron nails, and their armored husks were left at the
bottom of the memory-draining River Styx for 600 years.

When they rose, the mask wights marched out into the planes
to bury knowledge, conjure secrets, and erase their quarry from
memory and history.

**Ready for Betrayal.** Kept secret from one another, though,
the two each created an additional mask wight, a safeguard for in
case betrayal should cross their lover’s mind.

**Undead Nature.** A mask wight doesn’t require air, food, drink,
or sleep.

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:counterspell`, :ref:`srd:dispel-magic`, :ref:`srd:enlarge-reduce`, :ref:`srd:spider-climb`, :ref:`srd:tongues`

**Single-minded Purpose.** The wight has advantage on attack
rolls against followers of the fiend it is tasked to destroy and
those in its target’s employ (whether or not they are aware of
their employer), as well as the fiend itself.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The mask wight makes one Khopesh of Oblivion
attack and one Enervating Spiked Gauntlet attack.

**Khopesh of Oblivion.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage, and the
target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or some
cherished material thing disappears from the universe, and
only the target retains any memory of it. This item can be as
large as a building, but it can’t be a living entity and it can’t be
on the target’s person or within the target’s sight.

**Enervating Spiked Gauntlet.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d12 + 6) bludgeoning
damage plus 11 (2d10) necrotic damage, and the target must
succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or gain 1 level of
:ref:`srd:exhaustion`. The target recovers from all exhaustion caused by
the enervating spiked gauntlet at the end of its next long rest.

**Wail of the Forgotten (Recharge 6).** The mask wight emits an
ear-piercing wail. All creatures within 30 feet of the wight take
65 (10d12) thunder damage and are permanently :ref:`srd:deafened`;
a successful DC 17 Charisma saving throw reduces damage
to half and limits the deafness to 1d4 hours. Targets slain by
this attack are erased from the memories of every creature
in the planes, all written or pictorial references to the target
fade away, and its body is obliterated—the only exception is
those who personally witnessed the death. Restoring such a
slain creature requires a :ref:`srd:wish` or divine intervention; no mortal
remembers the creature’s life or death.
