Moss Lurker
-----------

*Somewhat like the cruel crossbreed of troll and gnome, the moss
lurkers are a primitive race of forest and cavern dwellers with
long, greenish beards and hair. Their hides are mossy green or peaty
amber, and a vaguely fungal scent surrounds them at all times.*

Like their trollish relatives, moss lurkers have large and often
grotesque noses. Their claws are bright red when unsheathed,
and their teeth tend toward the long and snaggly. They wear
simple clothes of homespun wool or leather, or go naked in the
summer. Their hats are sometimes festooned with toadstools or
ferns as primitive camouflage.

**Rocks and Large Weapons.** Moss lurkers have a
fondness for throwing stones onto enemies from a
great height, and they often employ enormous axes,
warhammers, and two-handed swords that seem much
larger than such a small creature should be able to lift.

**Camouflage.** A moss lurker has advantage on Dexterity
(Stealth) checks to hide in forested or swampy terrain.

**Love of Heavy Weapons.** While moss lurkers can use heavy
weapons, they have disadvantage while wielding them.

**Keen Hearing and Smell.** The moss lurker has advantage on
Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

**Poisoned Gifts.** A moss lurker can contaminate liquids or food
with poison. Someone who consumes the contaminated
substance must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving
throw or become :ref:`srd:poisoned` for 1 hour. When the poison is
introduced, the moss lurker can choose a poison that also
causes the victim to fall :ref:`srd:unconscious`, or to become :ref:`srd:paralyzed`
while poisoned in this way. An unconscious creature wakes if it
takes damage, or if a creature uses an action to shake it awake.
