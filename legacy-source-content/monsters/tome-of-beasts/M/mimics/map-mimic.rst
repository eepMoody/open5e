Map Mimic
---------

*This creature resembles a treasure map that flaps as if caught in a
strong wind, even in a dungeon where the air is perfectly still. When
touched, the map splits open, revealing its fanged mouth and face.*

**Mimic Spawn.** Mimic adhesive is not just a powerful means
of trapping prey, it also contains millions of microscopic
larvae that feed on flesh. Most of the larvae are consumed by
the mimic when it eats. Mimics are either unaware of this, or
they’re indifferent to the fact that they routinely cannibalize
their own offspring. A few manage to survive, however, by
adhering to the clothing or equipment of someone who escaped
from a fully-grown mimic’s attack. These larvae hitch a ride on
their host, far from the dungeon, cavern, or ruins of their birth.
There they drop off and grow into wormlike mimic young called
map mimics. In time, map mimics grow into typical mimics.

**Smaller than a Dinner Plate.** Map mimics are too small
to mimic the types of objects their parent does, but they
can still deceive prey
by altering their
forms. They can
assume the shape,
texture, and coloration
of anything up to the size
of a dinner plate.

**Paper Scrolls.** Their preferred
form is parchment paper, and they
can display the path they’ve followed,
complete with important landmarks,
on their hide. In this form, they curl up
and wait inside bottles, or in the clutches
of corpses in plain view, until another
unsuspecting adventurer discovers them.
Anyone who follows the “map” is led back to
the parent mimic, lying in ambush and hungry
to be reunited with its offspring.

**Shapechanger.** The mimic can use its action to polymorph into
an object or back into its true, amorphous form. Its statistics
are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or
carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Constrict Face.** When a map mimic touches a Medium or
smaller creature or vice versa, it adheres to the creature,
enveloping the creature’s face and covering its eyes and ears
and airways (escape DC 13). The target creature is immediately
:ref:`srd:blinded` and :ref:`srd:deafened`, and it begins :ref:`srd:suffocating` at the
beginning of the mimic’s next turn.

**False Appearance (Object Form Only).** While the mimic remains
motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary object.

**Mimic Page.** The mimic can disguise itself as any tiny, flat
object—a piece of leather, a plate—not only a map. In any
form, a map mimic can make a map on its skin leading to its
mother mimic.
