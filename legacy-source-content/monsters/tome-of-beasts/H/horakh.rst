Horakh
------

*Resembling a cave cricket the size of a dog, this beast wraps its
victim in spiny legs and claws when it attacks. A horakh’s black,
chitinous thorax is topped by a translucent digestive sac—often
containing half-digested eyeballs of varying sizes, colors, and species.*

**Leaping Claws.** Insectoid killing machines with a penchant
for consuming their victim’s eyes, the bloodthirsty horakhs
travel in small packs and make lightning-fast attacks against the
weak or vulnerable. Their powerful rear legs enable enormous
bounding leaps, while the sharp hooks at the end of their
powerful claws help them to climb and latch onto prey. Heads
dominated by scooped mandibles that can shoot forward like
pistons, shearing meat from bone.

**Leaping Screech.** When attacking, a horakh leaps from its
hiding spots while making a deafening screech. Horakhs are
highly mobile on the battlefield. If threatened, horakhs return to
the shadows to attack from a more advantageous position.

**Herd the Blinded.** After blinding their prey, horakh often
herd the blind like sheep until they are ready to consume them
and even use them as bait to capture other creatures. Many an
explorer has been ambushed, blinded, and condemned to death
in the bowels of the earth by these predators.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The horakh makes two
claw attacks and one bite attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8
to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
22 (4d8 + 4) slashing damage. If
the bite attack hits a target that’s grappled by the horakh, the
target must make a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or
one of its eyes is bitten out. A creature with just one remaining
eye has disadvantage on ranged attack rolls and on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on sight. If both (or all) eyes are
lost, the target is :ref:`srd:blinded`. The :ref:`srd:regenerate` spell and comparable
magic can restore lost eyes. Also see Implant Egg, below.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 17 (3d8 + 4) piercing damage. If both attacks hit the
same Medium or smaller target in a single turn, the target is
:ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 14).

**Implant Egg.** If a horakh’s bite attack reduces a grappled
creature to 0 hit points, or it bites a target that’s already at
0 hit points, it implants an egg in the creature’s eye socket.
The deposited egg grows for 2 weeks before hatching. If the
implanted victim is still alive, it loses 1d2 Constitution every 24
hours and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
After the first week, the victim is :ref:`srd:incapacitated` and :ref:`srd:blinded`.
When the egg hatches after 2 weeks, an immature horakh
erupts from the victim’s head, causing 1d10 bludgeoning, 1d10
piercing, and 1d10 slashing damage. A :ref:`srd:lesser-restoration` spell
can kill the egg during its incubation.
