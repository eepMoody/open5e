Hulking Whelp
-------------

*This gray-skinned dog-like creature seems pathetically eager to
please but fantastically skittish, its ears alerting at every nearby
sound, and its large oval eyes following anything that passes by.*

**Emotional Giant.** A hulking whelp is a tightly wound ball of
emotion, extremely private and defensive of its personal space,
and terrified of the world around it. When it feels its personal
space violated, or its fragile concentration is broken, the small,
quivery fey grows into a muscled beast of giant proportions.

**Calm Friend.** When its emotions are under control, a hulking
whelp is friendly and even helpful, although this has more to
do with its guilt over past actions and fear of what it might do if
it feels threatened than a true desire to help others. In its calm
form, a hulking whelp is just over three feet tall at the shoulder
and weighs 50 lb. Unleashed, it is 20 feet tall and 4,000 lb.

**Calm State.** When a hulking whelp is calm and unafraid, it
uses the following statistics instead of those listed above: Size
Small; *HP* 9 (6d6 – 12); *Speed* 20 ft.; *STR* 8 (-1); *CON* 6 (-2);

**Languages** Common, Sylvan

**Poor Senses.** A hulking whelp has poor hearing and is
nearsighted. It can see in normal or dim light up to 30 feet and
hear sounds from up to 60 feet away.

**Unleashed Emotion.** When a hulking whelp feels threatened—
it’s touched, intimidated, cornered, attacked, or even just
if a stranger moves adjacent to the whelp—it immediately
grows from size Small to Huge as a reaction. If
the whelp was attacked, this reaction occurs
after the attack is made but before damage
is done. Nearby creatures and objects are
pushed to the nearest available space and
must make a successful DC 15 Strength
saving throw or fall :ref:`srd:prone`. Weapons, armor,
and other objects worn or carried by the hulking
whelp grow (and shrink again) proportionally
when it changes size. Overcome by raw emotion,
it sets about destroying anything and everything
it can see (which isn’t much) and reach (which
is quite a lot). The transformation lasts until the
hulking whelp is unaware of any nearby creatures
for 1 round, it drops to 0 hit points, it has
5 levels of exhaustion, or it’s affected by a :ref:`srd:calm-emotions`
spell or comparable magic. The transformation isn’t entirely
uncontrollable; people or creatures the whelp knows and
trusts can be near it without triggering the reaction. Under
the wrong conditions, such as in a populated area, a hulking
whelp’s Unleashed Emotion can last for days.
