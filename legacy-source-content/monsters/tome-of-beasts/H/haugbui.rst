Haugbui
-------

*A thick swirl of dust rises, settles, and forms the vague outline of
a man—two points of yellow light shine where its eyes should be,
staring malevolently.*

**Mound Haunter.** A haugbui is an undead spirit tied to its
burial mound or barrow. It serves as a familiar, protective spirit to
nearby farmsteads or villages, so long as tribute is regularly paid
to the haugbui. Traditional offerings may include pouring the
first beer from a barrel, leaving portions of meals out overnight,
sacrificing blood or livestock, or burying a portion of any income
in the mound. A freshly-woken haugbui devours the remains of
creatures it was buried with, such as a hawk, hound, or horse.

**Milder Spirits.** Haugbuis are related to :ref:`tob:vaettir`, but much
older. They are more humble and less prone to taking umbrage,
and indeed, a great many haugbui have long since forgotten their
own names. They are not quick to spill blood when irritated, and
thus are viewed with greater tolerance by the living.

**Scrye and Watch.** They prefer to watch over their people from
within their mound, and only come forth over the most grievous
insults or injuries. They can do a great deal from within their
mounds thanks to their scrying ability.

**Undead Nature.** A haugbui doesn’t require air, food, drink,
or sleep.

following spells, requiring no material components:

**Constant:** :ref:`srd:detect-thoughts`, :ref:`srd:invisibility`, :ref:`srd:mage-hand`, :ref:`srd:scrying`

**At will:** :ref:`srd:dancing-lights`, :ref:`srd:druidcraft`, :ref:`srd:mending`, :ref:`srd:spare-the-dying`

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the haugbui fails a saving
throw it can choose to succeed instead.

**Sepulchral Scrying (1/Day).** An invisible magical eye is created
under the haugbui’s control, allowing it to watch its territory
without leaving the burial mound. The eye travels at the
speed of thought and can be up to 5 miles from the haugbui’s
location. The haugbui can see and hear as if it were standing at
the eye’s location, and it can use its innate spellcasting abilities
as if it were at the eye’s location. The eye can be noticed with
a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check and can be
dispelled as if it were 3rd-level spell. Spells that block other
scrying spells work against Sepulchral Scrying as well. Unless
dismissed by its creator or dispelled, lasts for up to 12 hours
after its creation; only one can be created per 24-hour period.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the haugbui has
disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on sight.

**Turn Resistance.** The haugbui has advantage on saving throws
against any effect that turns undead.
