Hundun
------

*A toothless mouth adorns the headless shoulders of this
oversized, four-armed, doughy humanoid. Colors and
half-formed phantasmal shapes appear and vanish around it,
to the creature’s obvious delight.*

**Creative Chaos.** Wise yet child-like creatures of
chaos, hunduns are four-armed, headless humanoids
that embody spontaneous creation and the confusion
that precedes enlightenment. Taking delight in creation
of all kinds, they bring change to the staid and stagnant,
spin revelation from confusion, and inspire moments of great
creation—from works of art to new nations and faiths, and even
the formation of planets and planes.

**Nonsense Speech.** Although not mindless, hunduns rarely
seem to act out of conscious thought, yet their actions seem wise
and usually benevolent. They communicate only in nonsense
words, but have no trouble communicating among themselves
or acting in coordination with other hunduns.

**Flesh of Creation.** Hundun blood is a powerful catalyst,
and their spittle a potent drug. Each hundun’s heart is an Egg of
Worlds—an artifact that can give birth to new concepts, powers,
or even worlds. Obviously, the hundun must die for its heart to
be used this way, but this is a sacrifice one might make willingly
under the right circumstances.

**Brainless.** Hunduns are immune to any spell or effect that
allows an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw.
Trying to contact or read a Hundun’s mind confuses the caster
as the :ref:`srd:confusion` spell for 1 round.

**Dance of Creation.** Hunduns can perform an act of magical
creation almost unlimited in scope every 1d8 days. The effect
is equivalent to a :ref:`srd:wish` spell, but it must create something.

**Enlightening Befuddlement.** When a hundun’s confusion spell
affects a target, it can elect to use the following table rather
than the standard one:

====== ==============================================================================================
1d100  Result
====== ==============================================================================================
01-10  **Inspired:** Advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
11-20  **Distracted:** Disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
21-50  **Incoherent:** The target does nothing but babble or scribble incoherent notes on a new idea.
51-75  **Obsessed:** Target is recipient of geas to create a quality magical object.
76-100 **Suggestible:** Target receives a suggestion from the hundun.
====== ==============================================================================================

**Innate Spellcasting.** The hundun’s innate spellcasting ability
is Wisdom (spell save DC 17). It can cast the following spells,
requiring no material components:

**Constant:** :ref:`srd:confusion` (always centered on the hundun), :ref:`srd:detect-thoughts`

**At will:** :ref:`srd:create-or-destroy-water`, :ref:`srd:dancing-lights`, :ref:`srd:mending`,
:ref:`srd:prestidigitation`

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:compulsion`, :ref:`srd:dimension-door`, :ref:`srd:black-tentacles`,
:ref:`srd:irresistible-dance`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:awaken`, :ref:`srd:creation`, :ref:`srd:heroes-feast`, :ref:`srd:magnificent-mansion`, :ref:`srd:plant-growth`, :ref:`srd:reincarnate`, :ref:`srd:stone-shape`
