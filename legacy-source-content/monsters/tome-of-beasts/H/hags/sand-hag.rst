Sand Hag
--------

*This withered crone glares malevolently, her face framed by lank
gray hair. Her malicious grin is filled with shark teeth, and drool
trickles from her lips.*

**Hatred of Beauty.** Sand hags are terrifying crones that
haunt desert ruins and forgotten oases. Their hatred for things
of beauty and peace is terrible to behold. A sand hag uses her
illusions and mimicry to lure travelers into an ambush.

**False Oasis.** They delight in tricking a caravan into an illusory
oasis, killing all the riding animals and pack animals so the
travelers can’t flee, and then terrifying and slaughtering them
one by one.

**Drain Bodies.** For the slaughter of animals or humanoids, a
sand hag prefers to rely on her claws, which drain the moisture
from their victims. They leave the mummified remnants in
postures of life—tied to a saddle, or atop a guard tower—to
terrify others.

Sand hags stand 6 to 7 feet tall, weigh less than 150 lb., and dress
in torn and tattered robes. Although skeletally thin, a sand hag’s
apparent frailty belies her prodigious strength.

**Magic Resistance.** The sand hag has advantage

**Innate Spellcasting.** The sand hag’s innate
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14).
It can innately cast the following spells, requiring
no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:invisibility`

**2/day each:** :ref:`srd:hallucinatory-terrain`, :ref:`srd:major-image`

**Mimicry.** The sand hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid
voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are
imitations only with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.

**Scorpion Step.** The sand hag walks lightly across sandy
surfaces, never sinking into soft sand or leaving tracks. When
in sand terrain, the sand hag ignores difficult terrain, doesn’t
leave tracks, and gains tremorsense 30 ft.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack:** The sand hag makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it
must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or
gain one level of :ref:`srd:exhaustion`.

**Scouring Sirocco (Recharge 5-6).** The sand hag generates a
blast of hot wind in a 30-foot line or a 15-foot cone. Creatures
inside it take 14 (4d6) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire
damage and are :ref:`srd:blinded` for 1 minute; a successful DC 14
Constitution saving throw halves the damage and negates
the blindness. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success. The affected area (line or cone) is heavily obscured
until the end of the sand hag’s next turn.

**Change Shape.** The hag polymorphs into a Small or Medium
female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are
the same in each form. Any equipment she is
wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. She
reverts to her true form if she dies.
