Idolic Deity
------------

*This small demonic idol fade into and out of reality. Its elemental
will presses on those near as a near-physical pressure.*

**Relics of Dark Gods.** Idolic deities are found in ancient
temples and deserted tombs. They are relics of an elder age and
all that remains of the favored children of deceiving dark god—
mighty lordlings. Sent to consume the
souls of those worshiping gods of light, these beings of shadow
and sand labored slowly through corruption of the soul rather
than outright war.

**Imprisoned Shadow Demons.** The corrupted ancient tribes
and their priests began worshiping them as gods, and they
forsook their master’s purpose to revel in their pride and vanity
until they were struck down for their treachery. They have since
wasted to a shadow remnant and been imprisoned in stony idols
that barely cling to solidity.

**Constructed Nature.** An idolic deity doesn’t require air,
food, drink, or sleep.

**Apostasy Aura.** The idolic deity’s presence causes devout
followers to doubt their faith. A cleric or paladin that can see
the idolic deity and wishes to cast a spell or use a class feature
must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
the spell or class feature is spent as if it was used, but it has
no effect.

**Incorporeal Movement.** The idolic deity can move through
other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It
takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Shadow Stealth.** While in dim light or darkness, the idolic deity
can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The idolic deity uses Seduce the Righteous and
makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 8 (1d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) psychic
damage.

**Seduce the Righteous.** The idolic deity targets one creature it
can see within 30 feet. The target has disadvantage on attack
rolls, saving throws, or ability checks (the idolic deity chooses
which) until the end of its next turn. A :ref:`srd:protection-from-evil-and-good`
spell cast on the target prevents this effect, as does a
:ref:`srd:magic-circle`.
