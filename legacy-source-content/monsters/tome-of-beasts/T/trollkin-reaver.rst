Trollkin Reaver
---------------

*In the north the masses huddle in fear at night, dreading the horns
and howls of reavers come to slaughter and pillage. The trollkin
reaver’s skin is thick and knobby, and it sports wicked talons
and tusks.*

**Fearsome Savages.** Trollkin have a well-deserved reputation
for savagery, and the reavers help reinforce that perception
among their neighbors.

**War Leaders.** Raiding is a staple industry among the trollkin,
and the reavers lead the most savage raiding parties in search of
wealth, slaves, and supplies. They often recruit other creatures
or mercenaries into their bands. It is not uncommon to see
bloodthirsty humans, gnolls, or hobgoblins in a reaver’s band.

**Spirit Talkers.** Trollkin reavers are quite fearful of spirits
and ghosts, and listen to their clan shaman and to the word of
powerful fey or giants. They prefer to raid only in times of
good omens.

**Regeneration.** The trollkin reaver regains 10 hit

function if the trollkin took acid or fire damage
since the end of its previous turn. The trollkin dies
if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t
regenerate.

**Thick Hide.** The trollkin reaver’s skin is thick and tough,
granting it a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is already factored
into the trollkin’s AC.

slashing damage if used with two hands. Using the battleaxe
two-handed prevents using the handaxe.
