Treacle
-------

*A curious bunny, an abandoned infant, or a delicate songbird
can spell slow and agonizing death for the unprepared.
Beneath any of these facades may lurk a treacle waiting to feed
on a gullible victim, mewling and cooing all the while. Whether
by natural selection or arcane tampering, these compact oozes
prey on kindness.*

**Diet of Blood.** Treacles feed on blood but lack the natural
weapons or acid of larger slimes. To survive, prey must
welcome and embrace them, unaware of the threat. The
treacles’ soft bodies absorb psychic impressions and take the
shape of unthreatening creatures. In the wild, treacles assume
the form of an animal’s offspring to lie close for several hours.

**Pet Polymorph.** Among humanoids, treacles
transform into pets, infants, or injured animals.
In the most horrific cases, these oozes resemble
children’s toys. Treacles don’t choose their forms
consciously, but instead rely on a primitive form of
telepathy to sense which shapes a potential victim
finds least threatening or most enticing. They can
hold a new shape for several hours, even if the
intended victim is no longer present.

**Slow Drain.** Once they have assumed a
nonthreatening form, treacles mewl, sing, or make
pitiful noises to attract attention. Once they’re
in contact with a potential victim, treacles drain
blood slowly, ideally while their prey sleeps or is
paralyzed. If threatened or injured, treacles flee.
A sated treacle detaches from its victim host and
seeks a cool, dark place to rest and digest. With
enough food and safety, a treacle divides into two
fully-grown oozes. Rarely, a mutation prevents this
division, so that the sterile treacle instead grows in
size. The largest can mimic human children and the elderly.

Treacles are small, weighing less than six lb. Their natural
forms are pale and iridescent, like oil on fresh milk, but they’re
seldom seen this way.

**Amorphous.** The treacle can move through a space as narrow
as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

**Charming Presence.** The treacle has an uncanny ability to sense
and to play off of another creature’s emotions. It uses Charisma
(Deception) to oppose Wisdom (Insight or Perception) skill
checks made to see through its ruse, and it has advantage on
its check.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Reshape.** The treacle assumes the shape of any tiny creature or
object. A reshaped treacle gains the movement of its new form
but no other special qualities.

**Blood Drain (1/hour).** A treacle touching the skin of a
warm‑blooded creature inflicts 4 (1d8) necrotic damage per
hour of contact, and the victim’s maximum hit points are
reduced by the same number. Blood is drained so slowly that
the victim doesn’t notice the damage unless he or she breaks
contact with the treacle (sets it down or hands it to someone
else, for example). When contact is broken, the victim notices
blood on his or her skin or clothes with a successful DC 13
Wisdom (Perception) check.
