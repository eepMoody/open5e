Lake Troll
----------

*This large, lanky creature has arms too long for its body. Its hands
are webbed and equipped with wicked claws. Its skin is covered
in dull green scales and embedded with stones,, and limp hair like
scraggly seaweed hangs across its long-nosed face.*

Water-dwelling cousins of the more common trolls, lake trolls
are both stronger and slightly more intelligent, but thankfully
less common. Accompanied by a reek of old, rotting fish, these
slimy creatures live beneath the surface of lakes, ponds, rivers,
and sometimes even ocean coves.

**Violently Territorial.** A lake troll is savage in the defense
of its claimed expanse of territory; any encroachment into the
creature’s water is met with sudden violence from the depths.
Fishermen are the most vulnerable to these attacks, especially
when they explore new bodies of water.

**Cruel Cunning.** Even seasoned soldiers are wise enough to
fear the claws of a lake troll; a person with no weapon facing
the creature is doomed. Lake trolls delight in splintering wood,
twisting metal with their talons, and dulling blades on their
tough hide. They often prioritize wielders of grand weapons so
they can delight in the horror of their newly-disarmed prey. Lake
trolls are cunning ambushers. They make use of the water to
cover their attack and to protect themselves from the flames of
would-be troll hunters.

**Hard to Kill.** A lake troll’s regeneration is shut down only
by cold and fire damage at nearly the same time, making them
tricky to fight and exceedingly difficult to kill. Many adventurers
have been shocked or slain when a lake troll they presumed
was burned to death suddenly leapt back into the fray. Because
they’re reclusive and so very lethal, these creatures are poorly
understood by most scholars.

**Amphibious.** The lake troll can breathe air and water.

**Keen Smell.** The lake troll has advantage on Wisdom

**Regeneration.** The lake troll regains 10 hit points at the start
of its turn. If the lake troll takes cold or fire damage, it regains
only 5 hit points at the start of its next turn; if it takes both
cold and fire damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of
the lake troll’s next turn. The lake troll dies only if it starts its
turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The lake troll makes one bite attack and two
claw attacks.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage.

**Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage. If the lake troll hits a
creature with both claw attacks in the same turn, the target
creature must make a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw
or its weapon (if any) gains a permanent and cumulative
-1 penalty to damage rolls. If the penalty reaches –5, the
weapon is destroyed. A damaged weapon can be repaired with
appropriate artisan’s tools during a long rest.
