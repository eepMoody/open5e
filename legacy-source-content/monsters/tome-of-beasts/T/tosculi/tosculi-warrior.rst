Tosculi Warrior
---------------

Tosculi warriors are overseers of work crews and battle
groups of drones, directing activities and relaying
commands from higher up in the hive mind. They are entirely
subservient to the hive-queen’s orders, but if ordered to act
independently or to follow their own best judgment, they’re
capable of doing so. Warriors are almost never encountered
without drones, and tower over them. They stand 4 to 5 feet tall
and weigh up to 70 pounds.

**Host Finders.** The warriors’ most important role in the
hive, however, is procuring live hosts for tosculi eggs to hatch
in. Creatures paralyzed by warriors are brought to the queen’s
chamber to have eggs implanted in them. An egg hatches in
1d6 weeks, and the ravenous larva devours its still-living (but
mercifully unconscious) host.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The tosculi warrior makes one bite attack, one
claws attack, and one stinger attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage.

**Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage.

**Stinger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature. *Hit:* 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against poison
or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A paralyzed target repeats the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
on itself on a success.

**Prepare Host.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
paralyzed creature. *Hit:* 10 (2d4 + 5) piercing damage, and
the target is paralyzed for 8 hours. The paralysis can be ended
with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check or by a spell
or magical effect that cures disease. (Because only paralyzed
creatures can be targeted, a hit by this attack is automatically a
critical hit; bonus damage is included in the damage listing.)
