Tosculi
-------

The tosculi are a race of wasp-folk that share the
Golden Song of the hive, which unites them
under the command and iron rule of their queen.
Each hive has its own song, and most tosculi
hives are predatory, dangerous places-quick to
turn to banditry, cattle theft, and raiding against
small villages.

Those few tosculi who do not hear their queen's
Golden Song are the Hiveless, driven out of the
embrace of the hive to attempt survive on their own.
