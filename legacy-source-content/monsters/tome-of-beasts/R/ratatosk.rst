Ratatosk
--------

*Chattering creatures with a superficial similarity to squirrels, the
ratatosk have tiny tusks and fur that shimmers in a way that defies
the surrounding light.*

**Sleek-furred Celestials.** The ratatosk is a celestial being
that is very much convinced of its own indispensable place in the
multiverse. Its fur is sleek, and it takes great pride in the cleaning
and maintaining of its tusks.

**Planar Messengers.** Ratatosks were created to carry
messages across the planes, bearing word between gods and
their servants. Somewhere across the vast march of ages, their
nature twisted away from that purpose. Much speculation as to
the exact cause of this change continues to occupy sages.

**Maddening Gossips.** Ratatosk are insatiable tricksters.
Their constant chatter is not the mere nattering of their animal
counterparts, it is a never-ending celestial gossip network.
Ratatosk delight in learning secrets, and spreading those
secrets in mischievous ways. It’s common for two listeners to
hear vastly different words when a ratatosk speaks, and for that
misunderstanding to lead to blows.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The ratatosk’s spellcasting
attribute is Charisma (save DC 14). It can
innately cast the following spells without
requiring material or somatic components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:animal-messenger`, :ref:`srd:message`,
:ref:`srd:vicious-mockery`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:commune`, :ref:`srd:mirror-image`

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:sending`, :ref:`srd:suggestion`

**Skitter.** The ratatosk can take the Dash,
Disengage, or Hide action as a bonus action
on each of its turns.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Gore.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 1 piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) psychic damage and the
target must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw
or be :ref:`srd:charmed` for 1 round. While charmed in this way, the
creature regards one randomly determined ally as a foe.

**Divisive Chatter (recharge 5-6).** Up to six creatures within 30
feet that can hear the ratatosk must make DC 14 Charisma
saving throws. On a failure, the creature is affected as if by a
:ref:`srd:confusion` spell for 1 minute. An affected creature repeats the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
on itself on a success.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Desperate Lies.** A creature that can hear the ratatosk must make
a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw when it attacks the ratatosk.
If the saving throw fails, the creature still attacks, but it must
choose a different target creature. An ally must be chosen if no
other enemies are within the attack’s reach or range. If no other
target is in the attack’s range or reach, the attack is still made
(and ammunition or a spell slot is expended,
if appropriate) but it automatically
misses and has no effect.
