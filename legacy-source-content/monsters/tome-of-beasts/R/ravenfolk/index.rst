Ravenfolk
---------
*While a huginn’s face resembles that of a great raven or crow, it
lacks wings and has a much more solid frame. Most are pitch black,
although a smattering have white feathers and red flecks.*

The ravenfolk are an avian race of scoundrels, schemers,
and sneaks—and they are much more
than that. Long ago when Odin
brokered the truce that brought
peace among the gods, the
wily deity magically created
the ravenfolk from feathers
plucked from his ravens
Huginn (Thought) and
Muninn (Memory.) He
placed this new race into
the world alongside elves,
dwarves, humans, and others to be
his spies.

**Odin’s Children.** To this day,
the ravenfolk are Odin’s agents
and embody his thought and
memory. They are thieves of
objects, yes, but primarily, they
are thieves of secrets. Their
black feathers and long beaks
are spotted on the road from
place to place, trading
information or helping
to hatch plots. They are
widely viewed as spies,
informers, thieves, and
troublemakers, but
when the ravenfolk swear an oath, they abide by it.

Odin grants the best of his ravenfolk magical runespears and
runestaves, two-handed heavy weapons enchanted to serve his
messengers. These function as long spears or quarterstaves in
the hands of other races. The ravenfolk consider them special
tokens meant for their use, and no one else’s.

**Flightless but Bold.** Though they have no wings and
normally cannot fly, the physiology of ravenfolk is strikingly
similar to that of true avians. They stand roughly 5 ft. tall and,
because of their hollow bones, weigh just 95-105 lb. Albino
ravenfolk are found in southern climates.

Ravenfolk eat almost anything, but they prefer raw meat and
field grains, such as corn, soy, and alfalfa. They even scavenge
days-old carrion, a practice that repulses most other humanoids.

**Feather Speech.** The huginn have their own language, and
they have another language which they may use as well: the
language of feathers, also known as Feather Speech or Pinion.
Ravenfolk can communicate volumes without speaking a word
through the dyeing, arrangement, preening, and rustling of
their plumage. This language is inherent to ravenfolk and not
teachable to unfeathered races.
