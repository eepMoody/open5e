Rift Swine
----------

*This enormous pig is as large as an ox, and its mouth bristles
with mismatched tusks. Its body is a lopsided mass of tumorous
flesh that gives way to eyes and vestigial
mouths, and long tentacles trail from its
sides.*

From time to time, a breach forms in the
fabric of the multiverse, and the Material
Plane is bathed in the energy of alien
dimensions. Living creatures exposed
to this incursion can undergo horrible
mutations, turning into monstrous
mockeries of their former shapes.
One example of this
phenomenon is the rift
swine: once-ordinary pigs
transformed into slavering
horrors after being bathed in
eldritch light.

**Destructive Herds.** Rift swine
travel in herds of 5-8 (and larger herds are
possible). Their effect on an area can
be catastrophic—they eat nearly
anything, possess a fiendish
cunning, and delight in the
destruction they cause. A rift
swine has difficulty perceiving
anything smaller than itself as a threat, leading it to attack most
other creatures on sight and fighting until it is destroyed.

**Abyssal Meat.** The rumors of vast herds of hundreds of rift
swine on strongly chaos-aligned planes, cultivated by the lords
of those places, are thankfully unconfirmed.

= ==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
1 **Acid boils.** A creature that hits the rift swine with a melee attack must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (1d6) acid damage.
2 **Tentacular Tongue.** Instead of using its tusks, the rift swine can attack with its tongue: Melee weapon attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is :ref:`srd:grappled` and :ref:`srd:restrained` as with a tentacle attack (escape DC 14).
3 **Covered in Slime.** Increase the rift swine’s AC by 1.
4 **Acid Saliva.** The rift swine’s tusk or tongue attack does an additional 3 (1d6) acid damage.
5 **Poison spit.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, range 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d12) poison damage.
6 Roll twice.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The rift swine makes one tusks attack and two
tentacle attacks.

**Tusks.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

**Tentacle.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target
is a creature, it is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 14). Until this grapple
ends, the target is :ref:`srd:restrained`, and the rift swine can’t use this
tentacle against another target.
