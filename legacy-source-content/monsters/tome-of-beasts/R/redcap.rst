Redcap
------

This grizzled, weather-beaten creature looks like a
sour old man at first glance, complete with scraggly
beard. It carries a great pike and wears heavy boots,
shod with iron, and the blood-soaked hat jammed on its
head is hard to miss. It grins with massive yellow teeth.

**Blood-Soaked Caps.** Redcaps are exceedingly
dangerous creatures who wear the mark of their cruelty and
evil quite literally. The caps from which they take their name
define their existence, and they must constantly be revived with
fresh blood.

**Compelled to Kill.** Redcaps aren’t cruel and murderous
by choice, but by necessity. A redcap must frequently bathe its
cap in fresh, humanoid blood to sustain itself. If it fails to do so
every three days, the creature withers and dies quickly. A redcap
whose hat is nearly dry is a desperate, violent force of nature that
prefers to die in battle rather than waste away to nothing.

**Bandits and Mercenaries.** Most long-lived redcaps are
drawn to serve in marauding armies or make a living through
constant banditry.

**Red Cap.** The redcap must soak its cap in the blood of a
humanoid killed no more than an hour ago at least once every
three days. If it goes more than 72 hours without doing so,
the blood on its cap dries and the redcap gains one level of
:ref:`srd:exhaustion` every 24 hours. While the cap is dry, the redcap
can’t remove exhaustion by any means. All levels of exhaustion
are removed immediately when the redcap soaks its cap in
fresh blood. A redcap that dies as a result of this exhaustion
crumbles to dust.

**Solid Kick.** The redcap can kick a creature within 5 feet as a
bonus action. The kicked creature must make a successful DC
15 Strength saving throw or fall prone.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The redcap makes two pike attacks and one bite
attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage and the creature is bleeding
profusely. A bleeding creature must make a successful DC 15
Constitution saving throw at the start of its turn or take 10
(3d6) necrotic damage and continue bleeding. On a successful
save the creature takes no necrotic damage and the effect
ends. A creature takes only 10 necrotic damage per turn from
this effect no matter how many times it’s been bitten, and a
single successful saving throw ends all bleeding. Spending an
action to make a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check
or any amount of magical healing also stops the bleeding.
Constructs and undead are immune to the bleeding effect.

**Pike.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.
