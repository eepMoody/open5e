Jotun Giant
-----------

*The earth shudders with every footfall of a Jotun giant, the
immortal enemies of the gods. Tall enough to look a titan in the eye
and strong enough to wrestle a linnorm, Jotun gaints are the lords
of giantkind. Their enormous halls are carved in mountains and
glaciers throughout the Northlands.*

**Foes of the Gods.** As foes of the northern gods, they plot
to regain their former status as lords of Creation. Many know
ancient secrets and snippets of antediluvian arcane lore, and
so may have abilities beyond those listed below. More powerful
Jotun giants straddle the line between mortal and demigod.

**Contests and Challenges.** Like many giants, the Jotun
enjoy a challenge, even from tiny little humans. Only the
mightiest heroes can challenge a Jotun giant’s might in physical
combat. Using cunning or trickery is a safer bet—though being
too cunning is also angers them, and Jotun giants are no fools.

**Seekers of Ragnarok.** The Jotun giants know great magic,
and strive to bring about end times of Ragnarok.

**Immortality.** Jotuns suffer no ill effects from age, and are
immune to effects that reduce ability scores and hit point
maximum.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The Jotun giant’s innate spellcasting ability
is Wisdom (spell save DC 19). It can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:earthquake`, :ref:`srd:shapechange`, :ref:`srd:speak-with-animals`

**3/day:** :ref:`srd:bestow-curse`, :ref:`srd:gust-of-wind`

**Magic Resistance.** The giant has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The giant’s weapon attacks are magical.

**Too Big to Notice.** The sheer size of the Jotun giant often causes
those near it to confuse one at rest for part of the landscape.
The jotun has advantage on Stealth checks when not moving.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The giant makes two greatclub attacks and a
frightful presence attack, or one rock throwing attack.

**Greatclub.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 30 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 55 (10d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, range 90/240 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 49 (6d12 + 10) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the giant’s choice that is
within 120 feet of the giant and aware of it must succeed on
a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for 1
minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each
of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a
creature’s saving throw is successful, it is immune to the giant’s
Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Jotun giant can take 1 legendary action, and only at the
end of another creature’s turn. The giant regains the spent
legendary action at the start of its turn.

**Detect.** The Jotun giant makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Planar Return.** If banished, a Jotun giant can return to the plane
it departed 2/day. If banished a third time, it cannot return.

**Sweeping Blow.** The Jotun giant can sweep its greatclub in
an arc around itself. The sweep affects a semicircular path 30
feet wide around the giant. All targets in that area take 46
(8d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage, or
no damage with a successful DC 19
Dexterity saving throw.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Rock Catching.** If a rock or
similar object is hurled
at the giant,
the giant
can, with a
successful
DC 10
Dexterity saving
throw, catch the
missile and take no
bludgeoning damage
from it.
