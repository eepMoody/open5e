Gray Thirster
-------------

*This dried-out body of a long dead traveler is still clad in the
tattered remains of his clothes. Skin as dry as parchment clings to
the bones that are clearly distinguishable underneath. A hoarse
moaning emanates from the dry, cracked lips.*

**Thirsting Undead.** The greatest danger to people traversing
badlands and deserts is thirst, and even the best prepared can
find themselves without water. The lucky ones die quickly, while
those less fortunate linger in sun-addled torment for days. These
souls sometimes rise from the sand as gray thirsters, driven to
inflict the torment they suffered upon other travelers.

**Destroy Wells and Oases.** Gray thirsters destroy or foul
sources of water and often lurk nearby to ambush those seeking
clean water.

**Thirsting Caravan.** Though they hunt alone, in at least
one case an entire caravan died of thirst and rose again as gray
thirsters. Called the dust caravan, it prowls the deep desert
accompanied by skinchanging gnolls, shrieking ghouls, and a
mummy lord, building a strange nomadic army.

**Undead Nature.** A gray thirster doesn’t require air, food,
or sleep.

**Thirst.** The gray thirster projects a 30-foot aura
of desiccating thirst. The first time a creature
enters the aura on its turn, or when it starts its
turn in the aura, it must make a successful
DC 12 Constitution saving throw or gain
one level of :ref:`srd:exhaustion`. If the saving throw
is successful, the creature is immune to the
gray thirster’s Thirst for the next 24 hours.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack:** The gray thirster makes two claw attacks and one
Withering Turban attack.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

**Withering Turban.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10
ft., one creature. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) necrotic damage. If the target
failed a saving throw against the Thirst trait at any point in this
encounter, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount
equal to the damage it took from this attack. This reduction
lasts until the target has no :ref:`srd:exhaustion` levels.

**Drought (1/Day).** The gray thirster draws the moisture from
a 20-foot radius area centered on itself. Nonmagical water
and other liquids in this area turn to dust. Each creature that
is neither undead nor a construct in the area takes 9 (2d8)
necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13
Constitution saving throw. Plants, oozes, and creatures with
the Amphibious, Water Breathing, or Water Form traits have
disadvantage on this saving throw. Liquids carried by a creature
that makes a successful saving throw are not destroyed.
