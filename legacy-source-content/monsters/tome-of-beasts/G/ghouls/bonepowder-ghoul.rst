Bonepowder Ghoul
----------------

*Distilled to nothing but dry, whispering sand and a full set of teeth,
a bonepowder ghoul still hungers for flesh and blood. Its dusty mass
is perfected corruption, entirely animated by foul energy.*

**Starved Into Dust.** The bonepowder ghoul is small and
unassuming, a pile of dust and bone fragments that resemble
a pile of mummy dust or the remnants of a vampire burned by
sunlight. Ghouls can achieve this powdery form through long
starvation. The process invariably takes decades, which is why
so few bonepowder ghouls exist—few ghouls can show such
self-restraint. Even among imperial ghouls, using hunger as
a form of torture is considered offensive and is quite rare. A
bonepowder ghoul may rise from the remnants of a starved
prisoner or a ghoul trapped in a sealed-off cavern, leaving
behind its remnant flesh and becoming animated almost purely
by hunger, hatred, and the bitter wisdom of long centuries.

**Mocking and Hateful.** Bonepowder ghouls are
creatures of pure evil, seeking to devour, corrupt, and
destroy all living things. The only creatures they treat
with some affinity are ghouls. Even in that case,
their attitude is often mocking, hateful, or
condescending. They have some mild respect
for darakhul nobles.

**Whispering Voices.** Most bonepowder
ghouls speak at least 4 languages, but
their voices are very faint. Just to hear
one speaking normally requires a
DC 15 Perception check. Undead
gain a +8 competence bonus to
this check.

**Amorphous.** The bonepowder ghoul can move through a space
as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

**Coalesce.** Whenever a bonepowder ghoul drains life force from
victims with Gravedust, it can use that energy transform its
shape into a more solid form and maintain it. The new form is
Small and semi-transparent but roughly the shape of a normal
ghoul. In this form, the ghoul isn’t amorphous and can’t form
a whirlwind, but it can speak normally and manipulate objects.
The altered form lasts for 1 minute for every point of necrotic
damage it delivered against living foes.

**Turning Defiance.** The bonepowder ghoul and any other
ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws
against effects that turn undead.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The bonepowder ghoul’s innate
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit
with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells,
requiring no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:chill-touch`, :ref:`srd:darkness`, :ref:`srd:dispel-magic`, :ref:`srd:ray-of-enfeeblement`

**3/day:** :ref:`srd:blindness-deafness`, :ref:`srd:circle-of-death` (7th level; 10d6)

**1/day:** :ref:`srd:finger-of-death`

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
18 (3d8 + 5) plus 1d4 Strength damage, and the target must
succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be :ref:`srd:paralyzed`
for 1d4 + 1 rounds. If the target creature is humanoid, it must
succeed on a second DC 19 Constitution saving throw or
contract darakhul fever.

**Gravedust.** A bonepowder ghoul can project a 40-ft. cone of
grave dust. All targets within the area must make a DC 19
Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking 4d8 necrotic damage,
and must make a second DC 17 Constitution saving throw to
avoid being infected with darakhul fever.

**Whirlwind (Recharge 5-6).** A bonepowder ghoul can generate
a whirlwind of bones and teeth. All creatures within a 20-foot
cube take 66 (12d10) slashing damage and are drained of 1d6
Strength; a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw reduces
damage to half and negates the Strength loss. The whirlwind
dissipates after one round.
