Gearforged Templar
------------------

*The bronze and mithral figure advances with heavy movements. Its
eye lenses glare dark blue, and gears click when it swings its glaive.*

An intricate construction of bronze, steel, copper, and mithral,
the gearforged templar is an imposing sight. A humanoid spirit
contained in a soulgem animates the heavy body of gears and
springs. Gearforged are relatively rare, and the champion is a
paragon among them.

**Tireless Defender.** The gearforged templar is relentless
in pursuit of its duty. More so then other gearforged, the
champion’s mindset becomes fixed on its charge to the exclusion
of distractions and even magical coercion. Gearforged templars
serve as commanders of military or guard units, bodyguards for
important individuals, or personal champions for nobility.

**Constructed Nature.** The gearforged templar doesn’t
require food, drink, air, or sleep.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Parry.** The gearforged templar raises its AC by 3 against one
melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the gearforged must
be able to see the attacker and must be wielding a melee
weapon.
