Salt Golem
----------

*A salt golem is a crudely sculpted, roughly humanoid crystalline
form that shuffles about on wide, stump-like feet. Tiny salt crystals
fall from its body in a glittering cloud with every step.*

**Coastal Druids.** These unnatural creatures are created by
druids and others living in coastal or desert regions, or by those
who seek to wage war with creatures susceptible to the warding
powers of salt. Stories tell of a druid who built a squad of nine
salt golems to combat a rampaging zmey. The salt warriors
waged a long hunt and eventually killed the powerful dragon in
its lair while the creator druid and her wizard companion reaped
the spoils of its hoard.

**Crystalline and Silent.** A salt golem has a crudely formed
humanoid body made of crystalline salts. It wears no clothing or
armor and carries no weapons or other possessions. It cannot
speak—the only sound it makes is the susurrus of sliding sand
as it moves. A salt golem is incapable of strategy or tactics.
It mindlessly fights until it destroys its opponents or until
ordered to stop by its creator.

**Valuable Remains.** A salt golem stands about eight
feet tall and weighs around 1,000 lb. A salt golem’s
body is formed from a composite of at least 1,000 lb
of rare salts and minerals worth at least 2,500 gp.

**Constructed Nature.** A golem doesn’t require
air, food, drink, or sleep.
