Eye Golem
---------

*An eye golem is muscular giant, well-proportioned with smooth,
marble-white skin covered in eye-like sigils. When it opens one
of its eyes opens for a moment, a beam as bright as the sun shines
forth, piercing the darkness.*

**Covered in Arcana.** Eye golems stand at least ten feet tall,
and their magically durable hide is covered with real eyes as well
as arcane sigils that resemble eyes.

**Blinds Victims.** An eye golem rarely kills its victims, but leaves
them blinded, wandering and tormented, seeing only visions of
the eye golem flashing through their memory. This drives some
mad while others instead choose to serve the golem, becoming
devoted to the one who still holds sight.

**All Eyes Open.** When killed, an eye golem does not simply
fall down dead. All of its eyes open at once, a deafening bellow
is heard for miles, and a blinding burst of light shines from
the body. When the light and noise stop, hundreds of perfectly
preserved eyeballs are left on the ground, still warm and fresh
and without scars or damage. Thin beams of arcane energy
connecting the eyes to their owners can be detected with a
successful DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Those who wield
the central eye once the golem is slain can use it to restore stolen
eyes to their victims.

**Constructed Nature.** A golem doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

**Gaze of Ancient Light (Recharge 6).** The golem emits a burst
of blinding light, affecting all opponents within 30 feet who
are visible to it. These creatures must make a successful DC
17 Constitution saving throw or be permanently :ref:`srd:blinded`. All
affected creatures, including those that save successfully, are
:ref:`srd:stunned` until the end of their next turn.

**Primal Voice of Doom (1/Day).** The golem intones a disturbing
invocation of the sun god. Creatures within 30 feet of the

**Shoot into the Sun (1 minute/day).** When roused for combat,
the golem opens many of its eyes, emitting blinding light. All
ranged attacks, including ranged spells that require a spell
attack roll, are made with disadvantage against the golem. The
effect persists as long as the eye golem desires, up to a total of
1 minute (10 rounds) per day.
