Hoard Golem
-----------

*A hoard golem is a pile of gold, jewelry, and weapons that can
rise on its own like a tidal wave of riches, with a cold and
determined face. A hoard golem can crash down with the
weight of a fortune, flattening everything in its path.*

**Dragon Fears Made Real.** The hoard golems
were born from the paranoia of dragons. Despite
their great physical and intellectual power,
dragons are always suspicious of any creature
willing to work for them. The first hoard
golem was created when a dragon realized
that there could be no guardian more
trustworthy with its hoard than the hoard
itself. Since then, the secret of hoard golem
construction has emerged, and rich nobles
have followed suit, enchanting their wealth to
defend itself from thieves.

**Patient Homebodies.** As constructs, hoard
golems are mindless, lying in wait for anyone
other than their creator to come within striking
distance. In the case of evil dragons, this may include
the wyrmlings of dragon parents looking to establish
dominance in the family. Hoard golems fight to the death,
but they rarely leave the rooms they inhabit for fear that
clever treasure hunters might trick the hoard into walking itself
right out of the owner’s den.

**Silent and Wealthy.** Hoard golems cannot speak. A hoard
golem is 25 feet tall and weighs 20,000 lb. A hoard golem’s body
is composed of items—copper, silver, gold, works of art, armor,
weapons, and magical items—worth at least 5,000 gp.

**Constructed Nature.** A golem doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

checks. A creature’s sheer glee on discovering a vast hoard of
treasure distracts it from its surroundings.

that would alter its form.

against spells and other magical effects.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The golem makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 39 (6d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**Thieving Whirlwind (Recharge 5-6).** The hoard golem
transforms into a 20-foot radius whirlwind of the treasures
of which it is composed. In this form, it has immunity to all
slashing and piercing damage. As a whirlwind, it can enter
other creatures’ spaces and stop there. Every creature in a
space the whirlwind occupies must make a DC 17 Dexterity
saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 40 (6d10 + 7)
bludgeoning damage and the whirlwind removes the most
valuable visible item on the target, including wielded items,
but not armor. If the saving throw is successful, the target takes
half the bludgeoning damage and retains all possessions. The
golem can remain in whirlwind form for up to 3 rounds, or it
can transform back to its normal form on any of its turns as a
bonus action.
