Fidele Angel
------------

*What appears to be a mated pair of animals changes shape into
two celestials. Their humanoid forms still bear some marks of
their animal selves. They move in perfect harmony.*

Fidele angels form from souls so devoted to each other that
their love transcends death.

**Friends to Lovers.** Fideles are charged with exhorting
mortals to respect the bonds of partnership. They assist lovers
facing obstacles and punish the enemies of love. Where there is
a conflict between two cultures’ laws in love, they prefer the
result that keeps the beloved together.

**Quiet Diplomats.** They prefer diplomacy to force and, despite
the urgency of love, they’ve been known to live secretly among
mortals for years or decades while waging quiet campaigns
against social mores and cultural norms that keep love from
achieving its full potential.

**Rage of Passion.** When love is denied, or when kept apart,
fidele angels can enter towering rages and an anger born of
passionate righteousness.

**Shapechange.** The angel can change between winged celestial
form, its original mortal form, and that of a Medium-sized
eagle. Its statistics are the same in each form, with the
exception of its attacks in eagle form.

**Ever Touching.** Fidele angels maintain awareness of their mate’s
disposition and health. Damage taken by one is split evenly
between both, with the original target of the attack taking the
extra point when damage doesn’t divide evenly. Any other
baneful effect, such as ability damage, affects both equally.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The angel’s innate spellcasting ability
is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It
can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material
components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:guidance`, :ref:`srd:light`, :ref:`srd:purify-food-and-drink`, :ref:`srd:spare-the-dying`

**3/day:** :ref:`srd:cure-wounds`, :ref:`srd:scorching-ray` (5 rays)

**1/day:** :ref:`srd:bless`, :ref:`srd:daylight`, :ref:`srd:detect-evil-and-good`, :ref:`srd:enhance-ability`,
:ref:`srd:hallow`, :ref:`srd:protection-from-evil-and-good`

**Magic Resistance.** The angel has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The angel’s weapon attacks are magical while
it is in eagle form.

**To My Lover’s Side.** If separated from its mate, each fidele angel
can use both :ref:`srd:plane-shift` and :ref:`srd:teleport` 1/day to reunite.

**Unshakeable Fidelity.** Fidele angels are never voluntarily
without their partners. No magical effect or power can
cause a fidele angel to act against its mate, and no charm or
domination effect can cause them to leave their side or to
change their feelings of love and loyalty toward each other.
