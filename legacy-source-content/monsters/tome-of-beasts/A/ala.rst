Ala
---

*Alas are born from galls that grow on treant trunks. Within this
parasitic pocket, an ala sickens the treant and consumes its life
force. When the treant dies, the ala is born in a black whirlwind.*

**Daughters of the Whirlwind.** Alas have windblown
hair and wear smoky black rags, but their true form is that of a
whirlwind, which can always be seen by šestaci, those men and
women with six digits on each hand. In flight or in battle, an
ala takes on a form with the upper body of a hag and a whirling
vortex of air in place of hips and legs. When an ala enters a house
in human form, the whole building groans in protest, as if it had
been struck by a powerful stormwind.

Alas live in the hollows of trees that were struck by lightning.
They are most active when thunder rocks the forest, and when
they travel hail or thunderstorms spawn around them.

**Enormous Appetites.** The huge-mouthed alas have voracious
appetites. In the wild, they devour wolves, bears, and badgers.
They prefer to hunt in settled areas, however, because they favor
the taste of innocents above all else. Unsavory tribes of savage
humanoids may beg an ala’s favor (or divert its wrath) with gifts
of bound captives.

**Energized by Storms.** In battle, an ala is constantly on the
move, weaving between foes like the wind. It tears at its foes
with claws and a poisonous bite, or throws wicked lightning
bolts and hailstorms from afar. Woe betides the hero who
confronts an ala while a storm rages overhead, because such
storms energize the ala and make its lightning stronger.
Because alas wield lightning with such mastery, some
sages associate them with
the god of lightning.
