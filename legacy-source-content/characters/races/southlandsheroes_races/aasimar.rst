Aasimar Racial Variants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although not, strictly speaking, different races, aasimar
come from a variety of lineages that may alter their
natural abilities.

**Airy Spirit.** Your divine ancestor came from the Heaven of Buoyant
Skies. At 5th level, you can cast :ref:`srd:gaseous-form` once as a 3rd
level spell, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long
rest. This ability replaces the ability to cast the :ref:`srd:daylight`
spell.

**Alternate Resistance.** You were raised on a fiery plane or are the
descendant of a fire godling. You have resistance to fire damage. This
ability replaces your resistance to necrotic and radiant damage.

**Celestial Awareness.** You were trained to use all your senses to
avoid surprise attacks and assassinations. You gain blindsight to a
range of 10 feet. This ability replaces darkvision, and your ability to
cast the :ref:`srd:daylight` spell.

**Heaven’s Wrath.** You have been trained to focus the light and
righteousness of the Seven Heavens upon your enemies as a weapon. You
gain the ability to cast :ref:`srd:guiding-bolt` once as a 1st level
spell, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
This ability replaces your ability to cast the
:ref:`srd:lesser-restoration` and :ref:`srd:daylight` spells.

**Divine Splendor.** Your celestial ancestor was a leader of angelic
hosts, and you can summon their divine aura and captivate those who
behold you. At 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast
:ref:`srd:enhance-ability` (eagle’s splendor) once with a range of
Personal as a 2nd level spell without the need to maintain
concentration, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a
long rest. At 5th level, you gain the benefits of both eagle’s splendor
and owl’s wisdom when you use this ability. A shining halo or nimbus
forms around your head while the spell is in effect, revealing your
divine nature. The glow from the halo is dim light with a ten-foot
radius. This ability replaces your ability to cast the
:ref:`srd:lesser-restoration` and :ref:`srd:daylight` spells.
