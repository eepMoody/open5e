Tosculi (Hiveless)
------------------

Tosculi (Hiveless) Traits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your tosculi character has several special traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** One of your physical ability scores
(Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) increases by 2, and one of your
mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) increases by 2.
You also take a –2 penalty to any one ability score. You may apply this
penalty to the same ability score to which you gave a +2 bonus, granting
you an overall +2 bonus to any one ability score.

**Age.** Tosculi reach maturity at around 13 years, but have shorter
lifespans than most races with few living longer than 40 years.

**Alignment.** The tension between tosculi and other humanoids often
makes it difficult for the Hiveless to develop any true sense of
altruism toward others, and many are neutral in alignment, with good
tosculi being rare, and evil ones more common. Hiveless tosculi are
equally likely to be chaotic, lawful, or neutral.

**Size.** Hiveless tosculi are no more than 4 feet tall and typically
weigh less than a humanoid of the same size. Your size is Small.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Natural Armor.** Your Armor Class cannot be less than 11 + your
Dexterity modifier no matter what armor you are wearing.

**Natural Attacks.** You have proficiency with your claws, which deal
1d4 slashing damage.

**Gliding Wings.** You take no damage from falls. You gain a fly speed
of 40 feet but cannot hover. At the end of any round you fly, you must
have descended at least one-quarter the distance you traveled or you
fall.

**Stalker.** You have proficiency in the Perception skill and Stealth
skill.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Tosculi and one other
language of your choice (typically Southern).

Alternate Racial Traits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Binding Spittle.** As an Attack action, you may spit a ball of viscous
fluid at a target within 60 feet that is Medium or smaller. Make a
ranged attack against the target with proficiency. If successful, the
fluid hardens upon impact and the target becomes :ref:`srd:restrained`.
As an action, the target can make a Strength check against a DC equal to
8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier to remove the
condition. Anyone adjacent to a creature restrained by binding spittle
may use their action to free the target in the same way. Dealing an
amount of bludgeoning damage equal to half your level plus your
Constitution modifier (AC 10) to the spittle also frees the target.
After you use binding spittle, you can’t use it again until you finish a
short or long rest. This trait replaces the Stalker trait.

**Bite.** Some hiveless tosculi develop the fierce mandibles associated
with the warriors that defend their hives. You can make a bite attack as
an unarmed strike that deals 1d6 slashing damage. On a successful hit
with a bite, you may attempt to grapple the target as a bonus action. At
11th level, your bite damage increases to 2d6. This trait replaces the
Stalker trait.

**Latent Hive Mind.** You know the :ref:`srd:message` cantrip. This
cantrip is a psionic ability that does not require components. The
cantrip also functions in a :ref:`srd:silence` spell. At 3rd level you can cast the
:ref:`srd:detect-thoughts` spell once, without the need for components,
and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. This
trait replaces the Gliding Wings trait.

**Hardened Carapace.** Some hiveless tosculi develop additional defenses
at the cost of offensive ability. Your Armor Class cannot be less than
11 + your Constitution modifier + your Dexterity modifier no matter what
armor you are wearing. This trait replaces the Gliding Wings and Natural
Armor traits.

New Tosculi Class Archetypes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tosculi are born with an unshakable sense of purpose and belonging
because of the golden song of the hive queen. Those few, sad wretches
who cannot hear the song must struggle to overcome the ever present void
within themselves. To that end, hiveless tosculi have access to the
following variant class paths for Druid and Ranger. Tosculi characters
follow their class progressions normally, but replace several class
features for the variants described below.

Variant Druid: Circle of the Hive (Circle of the Land)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hiveless druids turn to their connection to nature to fill the void
within themselves. This variant Circle of the Land druid creates an echo
of the golden song by reaching out to the memory of the hive, and
shaping magic with that memory. The so-called Circle of the Hive druids
gain access to the Hive land for their Circle Spells class feature.

=========== =======================================================

Vermin’s Ward
"""""""""""""

At 10th level, you become immune to poison and disease. In addition, you
ignore movement restrictions caused by webbing and gain advantage on
saving throws against being :ref:`srd:restrained`. This ability replaces
Nature’s Ward.

Variant Druid: Circle of the Swarm (Circle of the Moon)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hiveless tosculi who join the Circle of the Moon have their own way of
coping with their renegade status. Their shape-shifting powers create a
false hive song within. This allows the Circle of the Swarm druid to
access creature shapes unavailable to druids of other races.

Insectoid Forms
"""""""""""""""

Your wild shape feature works as the Circle of the Moon’s Circle Forms
with the following changes.

Your choice of forms is limited. You may use Wild Shape to change into
any insectoid, arachnid, or similar beast (such as a crab), though you
must still have seen the creature to do so. In addition, you gain access
to the following list of non-standard forms (you must follow the same CR
and ability restrictions as outlined in Circle Forms): :ref:`srd:ankheg`, carrion
crawler, death wasp (use :ref:`srd:wyvern` stats), giant rhinoceros
beetle (use :ref:`srd:triceratops` stats), and
:ref:`srd:swarm-of-insects` (all variants). Other insectoid forms may be
available at your DM’s discretion.

Monstrous Wild Shape
""""""""""""""""""""

At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to
transform into a :ref:`srd:bulette`, :ref:`srd:chuul`, :ref:`srd:phase-spider`, or umber hulk. This
ability replaces Elemental Wild Shape.

Variant Ranger: Hivemaster (Beast Master)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unable to form a connection with others of its kind, the hivemaster
finds kinship with insects of the natural world, forming bonds with them
and gaining the ability to rouse them against their enemies.

Hivemaster rangers parallel the Beast Master archetype, though they have
a more specialized list of companions to choose from.

Insect Companion
""""""""""""""""

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you
gain a trained beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures
and fights alongside you. You must select your companion from the
following list: blood hornet or wasp (use :ref:`srd:flying-snake`
stats), :ref:`srd:giant-crab`, :ref:`srd:giant-centipede`,
:ref:`srd:giant-wolf-spider`, or :ref:`srd:swarm-of-insects`. At the
DM’s discretion other insectoid beasts may be suitable companions, but
none should have a challenge rating higher than 1/4 (the swarm of
insects is an exception to this restriction).

You form a limited hive-mind that allows you to communicate
telepathically with your insect companion, as long as it is within 100
feet. You can issue commands to your companion verbally, or
telepathically.

In all other ways this ability is identical to the Beast Master’s
standard Beast Companion ability.
