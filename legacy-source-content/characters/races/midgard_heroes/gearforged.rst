----------

Gearforged Traits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your gearforged character has certain characteristics in common with all
other gearforged.

**Ability Score Increase.** Two different ability scores of your choice
increase by 1.

**Age.** The soul inhabiting a gearforged can be any age. As long as its
new body is kept in good repair, there is no known limit to how long it
can function.

**Alignment.** No single alignment typifies gearforged.

**Size.** Gearforged are as tall as either dwarves or humans, but they
weigh between 250 and 300 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Type.** You are of the humanoid (gearforged) type.

**Constructed Body.** Your consciousness and soul reside within a soul
gem to animate your mechanical body. As such, you are a living creature
with some of the benefits and drawbacks of a construct.

* You cannot eat, drink, or breathe. You can’t drink potions or gain
  benefits that come from drinking, eating, or inhaling vapors.
* You do not naturally sleep.
* During a rest, you must perform maintenance on your gears, springs,
  and joints, following the normal rules governing rest and activity.
  While performing this maintenance, you are aware of your surroundings
  but you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. If you go
  longer than 24 hours without performing maintenance (you don’t take a
  long rest), you gain one level of :ref:`srd:exhaustion`. All
  exhaustion gained this way disappears after your next long rest.
* You can’t be stabilized when dying with a Wisdom (Medicine) check or
  spare the dying. Instead, a successful DC 10 Intelligence check or a
  :ref:`srd:mending` cantrip is needed.
* You regain only one-half the usual number of hit points from spells or
  magical effects with the words cure, heal, or healing in their titles.

**Flesh of Steel.** You are immune to disease, poison damage, and the
:ref:`srd:poisoned` condition.

**Solid Construction.** If you are killed but your soul gem and memory
gears are still intact, you can be restored to life if your body is
repaired and soulforging is cast on it again. Because the body already
exists, the cost of the ritual is just 500 gp, plus the cost of
repairing the body (DM’s discretion, typically 1d4 x 50 gp). If your
body was destroyed but your soul gem and memory tapes are intact, they
can be implanted into a new body at the standard cost (10,000 gp). The
only other magic capable of bringing you back from the dead is a :ref:`srd:wish`
spell, which restores you fully.
