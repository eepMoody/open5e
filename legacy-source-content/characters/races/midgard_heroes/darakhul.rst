Ghoul, Darakhul

Darakhul Traits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your darakhul character has certain characteristics in common with all
other darakhul.

**Ability Score Improvement.** You Constitution score improves by 2.

**Age.** An upper limit of darakhul age has never been discovered; most
darakhul die violently.

**Alignment.** Your alignment does not change automatically, but you
have a strong draw toward evil.

**Size.** Your size is determined by your Humanoid Heritage (see below).

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is determined by your Humanoid
Heritage (see below).

**Type.** You are of the humanoid (darakhul) type.

**Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet as though it
were bright light and in darkness or bright light as if it were dim
light. You can’t discern color in darkness or bright light, only shades
of gray.

**Natural Weapons.** Your heavy jaw is powerful enough to crush bones to
powder. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage.

**Humanoid Heritage.** Darakhul arise from humanoid stock, and that
determines some of their traits. Choose one humanoid heritage from the
table and apply the listed traits.

**Hunger for Flesh.** You must consume a meal of raw meat each day or
suffer the effects of starvation. If you go 24 hours without such a
meal, you gain one level of :ref:`srd:exhaustion` (this is an exception to
the darakhul’s immunity). You cannot stave this off with half rations.
While you have any levels of exhaustion, you cannot regain hit points or
remove levels of exhaustion until you spend 1 hour consuming an amount
of raw meat equal to a Small creature (about 30 pounds).

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** When you, the target of your attack, or
anything you try to perceive is in direct sunlight, you have
disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
sight.

**Undead Vitality.** You are infused with the dark energy of undeath,
which frees you from some frailties that plague living creatures. You
have resistance to necrotic damage and immunity to poison damage. You
are immune to :ref:`srd:exhaustion` and to the :ref:`srd:charmed` and
:ref:`srd:poisoned` conditions. If you die, you cannot be returned to
life by :ref:`srd:revivify`, :ref:`srd:raise-dead`, or
:ref:`srd:reincarnate`; :ref:`srd:resurrection` and
:ref:`srd:true-resurrection` return you to life as your original race.
A create undead spell cast so that it targets only your corpse affects
you as a :ref:`srd:raise-dead` spell affects the corpse of a once-living
creature. You don’t need to drink or breathe. You don’t sleep the way
living creatures do, but during long rests, you enter a dormant state
resembling death; during that time, you have disadvantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Darakhul and Trade Tongue.
