Minotaur Traits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your minotaur character has certain characteristics in common with all
other minotaurs.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your
Constitution score increases by 1.

**Age.** Minotaurs age at roughly the same rate as humans but mature 3
years earlier. Childhood ends around the age of 10 and adulthood is
celebrated at 15.

**Alignment.** Minotaurs possess a wide range of alignments, just as
humans do. Mixing a love for personal freedom and respect for history
and tradition, the majority of minotaurs fall into neutral alignments.

**Size.** Adult males can reach a height of 7 feet, with females
averaging 3 inches shorter. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it
were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot
discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Natural Attacks.** You have proficiency with your horns, which deal
1d6 piercing damage when you make a horn attack.

**Charge.** If you move at least 10 feet toward a target and hit it with
a horn attack in the same turn, you deal an extra 1d6 piercing damage
and you can shove the target 5 feet as a bonus action. You can apply
this extra damage once per turn. At 11th level, when you shove a
creature with Charge, you can push it 10 feet instead of 5. You can use
this ability a number of times per day equal to your Constitution
modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

**Labyrinth Sense.** You can retrace without error any path you have
previously taken, with no ability check.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Minotaur, as well as one
other language of your choice (typically the Trade Tongue or Southern
languages).
