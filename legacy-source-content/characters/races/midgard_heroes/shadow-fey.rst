Shadow Fey Traits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shadow fey are a subrace of elf. They enjoy the base elven racial
traits, along with the following subrace traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 1.

**Alignment.** Although they have a malevolent reputation, the shadow fey
are not inherently evil. They tend toward chaotic neutral, though every
variation exists.

**Shadow Fey Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the rapier,
shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

**Path of Shadows.** When in darkness, dim light, or a shadow large enough
to cover your body, you can cast the :ref:`srd:misty-step` spell. You can use this
ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier
(minimum 1), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long
rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on
Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of
your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in bright
sunlight.

**Traveler in Darkness.** You have advantage on any Intelligence (Arcana)
check to learn about a particular fey road or shadow road and how it
functions.

**Extra Language.** You can speak, read, and write Umbral.
