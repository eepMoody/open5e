Open5e
======

Open5e aims to be the best open-source resource for 5e content.

.. Sidebar:: Hey! Stuff is missing!
   :class: missing

   Some content you may be expecting was not released as part of the `5e SRD <http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf>`_,
   so we aren't allowed to include it in this site.

   We are hoping to fill in the gaps using quality homebrew and 3rd party OGL content.
   `Contact us <mailto:gm@5esrd.com>`_ or `make a pull request <http://github.com/eepMoody/open5e>`_ if you know something we should add!

Try the New Open5e Beta today!
----------------------------------------------------------

The beta version of the new Open5e is now live, including the long-awaited API!

`The Open5e API <https://api-beta.open5e.com>`_ includes all monsters and spells from the SRD as well as a search API, so you can easily access any part of the SRD from your app or website.

The api-beta.open5e.com subdomain will remain indefinitely as the preview location for future API changes.

`The Open5e Beta Site <https://beta.open5e.com>`_ leverages that API to serve up a new (but familiar looking!) site that has all the same content but some nice new features including:

- Inline search previews for monsters and spells
- Better, faster search
- Filtering for spells and monsters

If you enjoy Open5e, join us on Discord to talk about it. 
Our discord is a place to talk about the redesign as well as rules, tools, art, gaming in general, or anything else on your mind!

Also consider supporting us on Patreon to help cover our (fancy new) server costs.
It will initially focus on better hosting and the rebuild in Django/Vue.js.

We will also start working on creating more supporting art for the 5e SRD.
