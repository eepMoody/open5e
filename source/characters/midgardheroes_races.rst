Flame or Fire Dragonkin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most common of the Four Elemental Kinds are the proud, boisterous
flame dragonkin. They can be insufferable braggarts, inspiring leaders,
and sometimes both. They bear yellow, golden, or orange scales, and red
crests. Flame dragonkin are strong, and they enjoy proving their
superior strength.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 1.

**Inner Flame.** You know the :ref:`srd:produce-flame` cantrip. Charisma
is your spellcasting ability for it.

**Resilient Scales.** You have resistance to fire damage.

Wind or Storm Dragonkin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wind dragonkin are only slightly less common than flame. They are driven
by a desire to know the world. They urge their kind toward expansion and
conquest, but less from a desire to rule than from a desire to
understand and experience. The wind dragonkin have blue, white, silver,
or gray scales, with black crests. Wind dragonkin are studious and
knowledgeable but far from passive.

**Storm Strike.** You know the :ref:`srd:shocking-grasp` cantrip.
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.

**Resilient Scales.** You have resistance to lightning damage.

Stone or Cave Dragonkin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The stone dragonkin are the most stoic and hardy of the Elemental Kinds.
What seems to outsiders like reserve is really patience; stone dragonkin
don’t reach conclusions without evidence and don’t jump into action
without considering the consequences. When they do act, it’s with the
same intense ferocity as any of their kin. Stone dragonkin grow scales
of gray, black, or rarely, white. Their crests or frills are purple or
white. Like the stolid dragons that are their forebears, stone dragonkin

is your spellcasting ability for it.

**Resilient Scales.** You have resistance to acid damage.

blue, or green scales with bright green or yellow crests. This breed of
dragonkin find success as spies and tacticians. Some take up the
priest’s mantle, most often in service to Seggotan, the sea god of the
Dragon Empire. Wave dragonkin are perceptive and strong-willed.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.

**Tide’s Grasp.** You know the :ref:`srd:poison-spray` cantrip. Charisma
is your spellcasting ability for it.

**Resilient Scales.** You have resistance to cold damage.

Edjet or Soldier Dragonkin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Despite the dragonkins’ love of their own racial purity, interbreeding
between the subraces does happen. The result is usually an edjet.
They’re recognizable by their brassy or tan scales with black or
rust-colored crests. Edjet make up a large segment of dragonkin presence
in the Mharoti armies, serving as heavy infantry and shock troops.
Despite the dragonkin’s usual slow speed, edjet have fast reflexes and
keen aim.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 1.

**Soldier’s Eye.** You know the :ref:`srd:shillelagh` cantrip. Charisma
is your spellcasting ability for it.

Gearforged
~~~~~~~~~~

Gearforged Traits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your gearforged character has certain characteristics in common with all
other gearforged.

**Ability Score Increase.** Two different ability scores of your choice
increase by 1.

**Age.** The soul inhabiting a gearforged can be any age. As long as its
new body is kept in good repair, there is no known limit to how long it
can function.

**Alignment.** No single alignment typifies gearforged.

**Size.** Gearforged are as tall as either dwarves or humans, but they
weigh between 250 and 300 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Type.** You are of the humanoid (gearforged) type.

**Constructed Body.** Your consciousness and soul reside within a soul
gem to animate your mechanical body. As such, you are a living creature
with some of the benefits and drawbacks of a construct.

.. TODO... No bullets show up in html output.

* You cannot eat, drink, or breathe. You can’t drink potions or gain
  benefits that come from drinking, eating, or inhaling vapors.
* You do not naturally sleep.
* During a rest, you must perform maintenance on your gears, springs,
  and joints, following the normal rules governing rest and activity.
  While performing this maintenance, you are aware of your surroundings
  but you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. If you go
  longer than 24 hours without performing maintenance (you don’t take a
  long rest), you gain one level of :ref:`srd:exhaustion`. All
  exhaustion gained this way disappears after your next long rest.
* You can’t be stabilized when dying with a Wisdom (Medicine) check or
  spare the dying. Instead, a successful DC 10 Intelligence check or a
  :ref:`srd:mending` cantrip is needed.
* You regain only one-half the usual number of hit points from spells or
  magical effects with the words cure, heal, or healing in their titles.

**Flesh of Steel.** You are immune to disease, poison damage, and the
:ref:`srd:poisoned` condition.

**Solid Construction.** If you are killed but your soul gem and memory
gears are still intact, you can be restored to life if your body is
repaired and soulforging is cast on it again. Because the body already
exists, the cost of the ritual is just 500 gp, plus the cost of
repairing the body (DM’s discretion, typically 1d4 x 50 gp). If your
body was destroyed but your soul gem and memory tapes are intact, they
can be implanted into a new body at the standard cost (10,000 gp). The
only other magic capable of bringing you back from the dead is a wish
spell, which restores you fully.

Ghoul, Darakhul
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Darakhul Traits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your darakhul character has certain characteristics in common with all
other darakhul.

**Ability Score Improvement.** You Constitution score improves by 2.

**Age.** An upper limit of darakhul age has never been discovered; most
darakhul die violently.

**Alignment.** Your alignment does not change automatically, but you
have a strong draw toward evil.

**Size.** Your size is determined by your Humanoid Heritage (see below).

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is determined by your Humanoid
Heritage (see below).

**Type.** You are of the humanoid (darakhul) type.

**Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet as though it
were bright light and in darkness or bright light as if it were dim
light. You can’t discern color in darkness or bright light, only shades
of gray.

**Natural Weapons.** Your heavy jaw is powerful enough to crush bones to
powder. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage.

**Humanoid Heritage.** Darakhul arise from humanoid stock, and that
determines some of their traits. Choose one humanoid heritage from the
table and apply the listed traits.

**Hunger for Flesh.** You must consume a meal of raw meat each day or
suffer the effects of starvation. If you go 24 hours without such a
meal, you gain one level of :ref:`srd:exhaustion` (this is an exception to
the darakhul’s immunity). You cannot stave this off with half rations.
While you have any levels of exhaustion, you cannot regain hit points or
remove levels of exhaustion until you spend 1 hour consuming an amount
of raw meat equal to a Small creature (about 30 pounds).

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** When you, the target of your attack, or
anything you try to perceive is in direct sunlight, you have
disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
sight.

**Undead Vitality.** You are infused with the dark energy of undeath,
which frees you from some frailties that plague living creatures. You
have resistance to necrotic damage and immunity to poison damage. You
are immune to :ref:`srd:exhaustion` and to the :ref:`srd:charmed` and
:ref:`srd:poisoned` conditions. If you die, you cannot be returned to
life by :ref:`srd:revivify`, :ref:`srd:raise-dead`, or
:ref:`srd:reincarnate`; :ref:`srd:resurrection` and
:ref:`srd:true-resurrection` return you to life as your original race.
A create undead spell cast so that it targets only your corpse affects
you as a :ref:`srd:raise-dead` spell affects the corpse of a once-living
creature. You don’t need to drink or breathe. You don’t sleep the way
living creatures do, but during long rests, you enter a dormant state
resembling death; during that time, you have disadvantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Darakhul and Trade Tongue.
