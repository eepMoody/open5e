Centaur Traits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your centaur character has certain characteristics in
common with all other centaurs.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 2,
and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

**Age.** Centaurs reach maturity at 15 years of age. Their
lifespans vary because of the harsh conditions and
martial nature of their culture, but the upper limits are
similar to those of humans.

**Alignment.** Centaur alignments are
mainly chaotic and neutral.

**Size.** Centaurs stand between 8 and 9
feet tall and weigh in excess of 2,000
pounds. Your size is Large.

**Speed.** Centaurs have a base speed of 40 feet.

**Type.** You are of the monstrosity type.

**Natural Attacks.** You have proficiency with your hooves.
You make one attack with your hooves, which deal 2d6
bludgeoning damage.

**Centaur Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the
pike and the longbow.

**Pike Charge.** If you move at least 30 feet straight toward
a target and then hit it with a pike attack on the same
turn, the target takes an extra 3 (1d6) piercing damage.
The number of extra damage dice you gain increases by
one at 6th level (2d6) and again at 11th level (3d6). You
can apply this extra damage only once per turn. You can
use this ability a number of times per day equal to your
Constitution modifier (minimum 1), and you regain all
expended uses when you finish a long rest.

**Humanoid Torso.** Although you are Large, you wield
weapons and wear armor sized for a Medium creature,
thanks to the proportions of your humanoid torso.

**Quadruped.** You have disadvantage on Stealth checks
because of your size and indelicate hooves. The
mundane details of the structures of humanoids can
present considerable obstacles for you, such as ladders
and manholes.

**Self-sufficient.** You have proficiency with the Medicine skill.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Centaur and
one other language of your choice.
