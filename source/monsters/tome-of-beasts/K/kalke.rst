Kalke
-----

*Combining the head of a goat and the body of a monkey makes the
creature odd enough; combining the social grace of a baboon with
pretensions of a scholar makes it more comical than threatening.*

Fiendish pests that infest derelict wizards’ towers and
laboratories, the kalkes are either the by-product of
botched gates into the lower realms or the
personification of an evil deity’s
contempt for wizards. All
kalkes act with the arrogance
of magi while having the social
characteristics of baboons. Being of
fiendish blood, kalkes do not age and
require neither food nor drink. Though
lacking any formal spellcasting ability,
all kalkes can produce magical effects
through the dramatic mumming of largely
spontaneous and unstudied rituals.

**Hoard Magical Paraphernalia.** The
drive to produce ever more fanciful rituals
gives a kalke the compulsion to accumulate
spell components, magical foci, and other occult
paraphernalia. Although these objects serve no purpose,
the kalkes seek out spellcasters in their vicinity and steal any
paraphernalia they can find. Because they have no ability to
distinguish what’s magically useful from what isn’t, they grab
any jewelry, pouches, sticks, or ornate objects they uncover.
Sometimes children, animals, or other small humanoids are
taken to be used as sacrifices, if they can be easily carried away.

**Perform Rituals.** Troops of kalkes inhabit trees, caverns,
and ruins around sites of significant magical activity. Twice
a month, or more during major astrological and seasonal
events, the kalkes gather to perform—by way of dance, chant,
and sacrifice—an imagined rite of great magic. The effort has
an equal chance of achieving nothing whatsoever, causing
dangerous but short-lived misfortunes (snakes raining on the
countryside, creatures summoned from the lower planes), or
triggering calamities (great fires or floods).

An additional side effect of these rituals is that the troop may
gain or lose members magically. If the troop numbers less than
13, a new kalke appears as if from nowhere; if it contains 13 or
more members, then 3d4 of them find themselves mysteriously
gated to the nearest location of magical activity—often
hundreds of miles away. Those teleported arrive in a state of
hysteria, with individuals extinguishing flames, grabbing
frippery, and running in all directions. Because kalkes have no
control over their displacement, it’s not surprising to find them
in abandoned dungeons or keeps, clutching the property of
some long-lost wizard.

**Hagglers.** The kalkes will return the goods they've taken, in
exchange for a ransom or fee. These exchanges need to have the
outward appearance of being impressively in the kalke’s favor.
A particularly generous (or devious) spellcaster may be able to
reach an accommodation with a persistent local troop of kalkes.
