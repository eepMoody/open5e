Kikimora
--------

*This strange-looking humanoid combines the
features of an old crone and some manner of
bird. A shawl covers her head but cannot contain her
prominent beak and clawed hands. Her skirt reveals
bird-like feet.*

**Filthy Illusions.** Kikimoras are devious house
spirits who torment those they live with unless
they are catered to and cajoled. They delight
in harassing homeowners with their illusions,
making a house look much filthier than it actually
is. Their favored illusions include mold, filth, and
scuttling vermin.

They love secretly breaking things or making
such destruction seem like an accident. They then
convince the house’s residents to leave gifts as
enticement for making repairs in the night.

**Brownie Hunters.** Kikimoras hate brownies.
While brownies can be mischievous, kikimoras
bring pain and frustration on their housemates
instead of remaining hidden and helping chores along.
Some brownies seek out kikimora‑infested homes with
the intention of evicting them.

If homeowners refuse to appease the kikimora (or
cannot rid themselves of her devious presence), the
kikimora sends a swarm of spiders, rats, or bats. Many
times inhabitants in a home plagued by a kikimora believe it is
haunted.

**Fast Talkers.** While they try to avoid notice and aren’t great
talespinners, kikimoras are convincing and use this influence to
gain an upper hand—or to evade capture or avoid violence.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The kikimora makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

**Hidey-Hole.** When a kikimora chooses a house to inhabit,
she scrawls a symbol on a wall, baseboard, cupboard, or
semi‑permanent object (like a stove) to be her tiny domain.
This ability creates a hidden extra-dimensional dwelling. After
creating a hidey-hole, a kikimora can teleport herself and
up to 50 lb of objects to the designated location instead of
making a normal move. This extradimensional space can only
be entered by the kikimora or by a creature using a :ref:`srd:plane-shift`
spell or ability. The location can be determined by casting
:ref:`srd:detect-magic` in the area of the sigil, but it takes a successful
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to plane shift into the space.
Inside the hidey-hole, a kikimora can see what is going
on outside the space through a special sensor. This sensor
functions like a window, and it can be blocked by mundane
objects placed in front of the sigil. If she leaves an item in
her space, it remains there even if she removes the sigil and
places it in another location. If someone else removes the sigil,
all contents are emptied into the Ethereal Plane (including
any beings within her hidey-hole at the time). In this case,
the kikimora can attempt a DC 15 Charisma saving throw to
instead eject herself (but none of her possessions) into a space
adjacent to the sigil.
