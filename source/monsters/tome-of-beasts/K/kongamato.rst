Kongamato
---------

*The kongamato is an evolutionary holdover,
a large pterodactyl with avian traits, such as
emergent feathers and long, beaklike jaws.*

**Boat Breaker.** Its name means "breaker of
boats," and as that implies, this creature
systematically destroys the small
vessels of those who come too close to
its perch. No one knows what motivates
this form of attack, although some sages
suppose that the kongamato mistakes
canoes for large prey like hippopotami
or crocodiles.

**Spoken in Whispers.** For some
tribes, kongamatos present a terrible
threat, and they speak in whispers
about them, fearing that mention
of the beasts could attract their
wrath. In some cases, evil priests
and cultists summon these beasts
as their servitors and use them to
terrify villagers.

**Maneaters.** Kongamatos that
have eaten human flesh develop a
preference for it. These maneaters
perform nightly raids on small
towns, snatching children and
Small humanoids with their
claws and flying away.
