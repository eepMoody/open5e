Zmey Headling
-------------

A zmey’s head doesn’t die when severed from the body. Instead,
the head rapidly (within 2d6 rounds) sprouts a stunted body
and two vestigial claws with which it can fight and drag itself
across the ground. Within days it develops into a complete,
miniature zmey, and by the time two lunar cycles elapse, the
head regenerates into a full-grown :ref:`tob:zmey` with three heads.

**Constant Feeding Frenzy.** Such rapid growth is fueled by
a voracious appetite. A zmey headling eats everything it can,
including its previous body, to satisfy its intense, maddening
hunger and sustain its regeneration. Many stories about the
horrific violence of the zmey are reports of voracious headlings,
not mature zmey.
