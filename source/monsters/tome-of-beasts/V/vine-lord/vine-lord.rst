Vine Lord
---------

*Covered with dark green bark and twining tendrils, this longlimbed humanoid exudes a palpable aura of horror.*

**Melding of Flesh and Vine.** Vine lords are formed from
the union of full-grown tendril puppets and the force-grown
descendants of plantfolk. Their servants include most
plant species, including tendril puppets and vine troll
skeletons.

**Walking Forests.** Vine lords seek to expand and
empower forests and jungles in the service of their
patron gods and demons, or simply to expand their own
power. In many cases, they compel trees to walk into
grasslands or plowed fields on moonless nights, claiming
that territory for the trees.

**Green Strider.** The vine lord ignores
movement restrictions and damage
caused by natural undergrowth.

**Magic Resistance.** The vine lord has
advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

**Regeneration.** The vine lord regains 10
hit points at the start of its turn if it has at
least 1 hit point and is within its home forest or jungle.

**Root Mind.** Within its home forest or jungle, the vine lord’s
blindsight extends to 60 ft., it succeeds on all Wisdom
(Perception) checks, and it can’t be surprised.

**Spore Sacs (1/week).** The vine lord can release seeds from
specialized sacs on its tendrils. These seeds sprout into 1d4
green spore pods that reach maturity in 3 days. The pods
contain noxious spores that are released when the pod is
stepped on, picked, or otherwise tampered with. A humanoid
or beast that inhales these spores must succeed on a DC 14
Constitution saving throw against disease or tendrils start
growing inside the creature’s body. If the disease is not cured
within 3 months, the tendrils take over the creature’s nervous
system and the victim becomes a tendril puppet.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack:** The vine lord makes two claw attacks and four
tendril attacks. A single creature can’t be the target of more
than one tendril attack per turn.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage.

**Tendril.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 7 (1d4 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage.

**Awaken the Green (1/Day).** The vine lord magically animates
one or two trees it can see within 60 feet of it. These trees have
the same statistics as a treant, except they have Intelligence
and Charisma scores of 1, they can’t speak, and they have only
the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the
vine lord. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies;
until the vine lord dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree;
or until the vine lord takes a bonus action to turn it back into
an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible.
