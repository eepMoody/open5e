Vila
----

*These beautiful, slim women ride on large deer, their hair the
color of spring grass, skin like polished wood, and eyes as gray as a
coming storm.*

**Dryad Cousins.** The vila are kin to the dryads. Like their
cousins, they serve as protectors of the deepest forests.

**Demand Oaths.** Where dryads beguile to accomplish their
goals, the vila coerce and threaten. They demand oaths from
interlopers and enforce them fiercely. Vila delight in testing
the virtue of travelers and tormenting the uncharitable and
cruel with bad weather and misfortune. Particularly obnoxious
adventurers might suffer bad luck for months because a troop of
vila quietly dances around their camp each night.

**Hunt with a Pack.** Vila rarely travel or fight alone; they are
often seen in the company of alseid, wolves, wampus cats, or
deer. In combat, they sometimes ride on fleet-footed deer, the
better to escape if events turn against them.

**Forest Meld.** A vila can meld into any tree in her forest for as
long as she wishes, similar to the meld into stone spell.

Charisma (spell save DC 14). She can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**3/day:** sleep

**1/week:** control weather

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** A vila makes two shortsword attacks or two
shortbow attacks.

**+1 Shortsword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 9 (1d6 + 6) piercing damage.

**+1 Shortbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, range 80/320
ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d6 + 6) piercing damage.

**Fascinate (1/Day).** When the vila sings, all those within 60 feet
of her and who can hear her must make a successful DC 14
Charisma saving throw or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Those
who succeed on the saving throw are immune to that vila’s
singing for 24 hours.

**Forest Song (1/Day):** The vila magically calls 2d6 wolves or 2
wampus cats. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting
as allies of the vila and obeying its spoken commands. The
beasts remain for 1 hour, until the
vila dies, or until the vila dismisses
them as a bonus action.
