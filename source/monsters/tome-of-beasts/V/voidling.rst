Voidling
--------

*Writhing black tendrils stretch from this indistinct orb
of pure shadow. The faintest flicker of something
green, like an eye, appears for a moment in the
center of the globe and then fades to black again.*

**Called from Darkness.** Voidlings are creatures of
the darkest void, the cold space between the stars, drawn
to mortal realms by practitioners of foul and corrupting
magic known to break the minds of those who wield it.
They frequently are summoned servants to void dragons,
and they have been seen as wardens of the temples on the
Plateau of Leng.

**Light Eaters.** They are said to devour life and
knowledge and light itself as sustenance; the places they
inhabit are known for their dank chill and their obscurity.
Voidlings are summoned by those hungry for power at any
cost, and—despite their dark reputation—they serve very
well for years or even decades, until one day they turn on
their summoners. If they succeed in slaying their summoner,
they grow in strength and return to the void. Exactly what
voidlings seek when they have not been summoned—and
what triggers their betrayals—is a mystery.

**Cold Tendrils.** Creatures of utter darkness, they can
barely be said to have a shape; they consist largely of lashing
tendrils of solid shadow. The tendrils meet at a central point
and form a rough sphere in which something like an eye
appears intermittently.

Though their tentacles stretch 10 feet long, the core of a
voiding is no more than 4 feet across, and it weighs nothing,
darting through either air or void with impressive speed.
