Valkyrie
--------

*These warrior women, armed with cruel-looking swords, sit astride
massive winged wolves. Each of them is as beautiful, graceful, and
fierce as a well-honed war ax.*

**Choosers of the Slain.** Valkyries are sent by Odin to decide
the course of battles and harvest the souls of brave fallen warriors.
Riding savage winged wolves (winter wolves with a fly speed of 80
feet), they visit battlefields to do their master’s will, surrounded
by crows and ravens. Valkyries remain invisible during these
missions, dispensing bane or bless spells as fate decrees.

**Despise Humanoids.** They love animals, especially birds, but
are scornful of humanoids as weak and cowardly. All valkyries
love battle and bloodshed, and many are savage and callous.

**Neutral Parties.** Valkyries seldom interfere in mortal affairs,
save to ensure the proper course of battles. Upon occasion when
duty demands, or sometimes as a punishment or, rarely, when
they fall in love, a valkyrie may wander the mortal world.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A valkyrie can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature’s turn. A valkyrie regains spent
legendary actions at the start of her turn.

**Cast a Cantrip.** The valkyrie casts one spell from her at-will list.

**Spear or Longsword Attack.** The valkyrie makes one longsword
or spear attack.

**Harvest the Fallen (Costs 2 Actions).** A valkyrie can take the
soul of a newly dead body and bind it into a weapon or shield.
Only one soul can be bound to any object. Individuals whose
souls are bound can’t be raised by any means short of a wish
or comparable magic. A valkyrie can likewise release any soul
that has been bound by another valkyrie, or transfer a bound
soul from one object to another. Once bound, the soul grants
the item a +1 bonus for every 4 character levels of the soul,
and this replaces any other magic on the item. At the DM’s
discretion, part of this bonus can become an appropriate
special quality (a fire giant’s soul might create a flaming
weapon, for example).
