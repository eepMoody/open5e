Vampire, Umbral
---------------

*An umbral vampire is a fiendish creature, once human but twisted
into a dark reflection by an ancient curse. It resembles a deathly
pale, gaunt human with stringy hair, dressed in scant rags. Misty
strands of darkness leak from its empty eye sockets, yawning nasal
cavity, and mouth.*

**Cursed Origin.** Legends speak of an ancient city whose
origins are lost to the ages, where a cabal of wizards with
the power to manipulate the flow of time made its citizens
immortal. When the wizards fell and no longer held back the
ravages of time, the citizens aged centuries in moments. Instead
of dying, the wretches lingered on in their dark realm.

**Bound to Darkness.** All umbral vampires originate in the
City Fallen into Shadow, and under most circumstances, they’re
encountered only in that forsaken place. Despite the terrors it
holds, adventurers continue to seek out the city, chasing legends
of potent artifacts and boundless treasure accumulated during
its golden age. Occasionally, an umbral vampire slips into the
mortal world, where it hides in a place seldom or never touched
by sunlight and emerges at night to search for victims.

**Shadowy Nature.** An umbral vampire doesn’t require air,
food, drink, or sleep.

**Umbral Grasp.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 18 (4d6 + 4) cold damage and the target’s Strength
score is reduced by 1d6. The target dies if this reduces its
Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target
finishes a short or long rest.

If a non-evil humanoid dies from this attack, a shadow rises
from the corpse 1d4 hours later.
