Vesiculosa
----------

*This glittering pool stands among lush and verdant fruiting plants.*

**Underground Oasis.** A vesiculosa is a huge, burrowing
pitcher plant that dwells in oases, spurring nearby growth
and luring in prey with soporific scents and tainted water. A
vesiculosa’s body is buried in the ground, with only its rootlets
swarming in the open in ropy tangles. It catches meals with these
rootlets and drags them to its mouth. Usually these morsels are
unconscious, but the rootlets can put up a fight if they must.

**Rich Sapphire Heartvine.** A vesiculosa’s heartvine resembles
a lump of sapphire and is highly prized by alchemists (worth
1,000 gp). It can be reached with an hour or two of hard digging.

**False Appearance.** While the vesiculosa remains motionless, it
is indistinguishable from a normal pool of water.

**Rootlet Swarms.** The vesiculosa is surrounded at all times
by four Medium swarms of Tiny rootlets that move as the
vesiculosa directs. Each swarm has a speed of 30 feet, can
be targeted independently, has 25 hit points, and (unlike the
parent plant) quite vulnerable to fire damage. Other than that,
they have the same statistics as the vesiculosa’s main body. For
each swarm that drops to 0 hit points, the vesiculosa loses one
of its Entrap attacks. A destroyed swarm regrows in 24 hours.

**Sweet Water.** The vesiculosa’s pool emits a sweet fragrance
that lures creatures to drink. Creatures that are neither undead
nor constructs within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 16
Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to approach
the vesiculosa and drink. The water is cool and
refreshing but carries a sleeping poison:
any creature (other than undead and
constructs) that drink it regain 1d4
hit points and recover from 1 level
of exhaustion, but must succeed on
a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against
poison or fall unconscious for 1 minute. If the
saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is
unconscious for 1 hour. An unconscious creature
wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature
uses an action to shake it awake.

**Verdant.** The vesiculosa’s sap seeps into the soil, promoting
lush vegetation. At any given time, 3d6 beneficial fruits (fruit,
nuts, figs, dates) can be found within 30 feet of the vesiculosa.
These have the same effect as berries from a goodberry spell,
but they retain their potency for one week after being picked
or after the vesiculosa is killed.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The vesiculosa uses Entrap 4 times, and uses
Reel and Engulf once each. It loses one Entrap attack for each
rootlet swarm that’s been destroyed.

**Entrap.** The vesiculosa targets a Large or smaller creature within
5 feet of one of its rootlet swarms. The target takes 10 (4d4)
piercing damage and is grappled (escape DC 15), or takes
half damage and isn’t grappled if it makes a successful DC
17 Dexterity saving throw. Until the grapple ends, the target
is restrained, it has disadvantage on Strength checks and
Strength saving throws, and that rootlet swarm can’t entrap
another target.

**Reel.** Each rootlet swarm that has a creature grappled moves up
to 20 feet toward the vesiculosa’s main body. Rootlets wander
up to 100 feet from the main body.

**Engulf.** The vesiculosa engulfs all restrained or unconscious
creatures within 5 feet of its main body (up to 2 Large,
4 Medium or 8 Small creatures). An engulfed creature is
restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects
outside the vesiculosa, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the
start of each of the vesiculosa’s turns. When the vesiculosa
moves, the engulfed creature
moves with it. An engulfed
creature can try to escape by
using an action to
make a DC 15 Strength
check. On a success, the
creature escapes and
enters a space of its
choice within 5 feet
of the vesiculosa’s
main body.
