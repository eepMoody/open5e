Guardian (Shadow Fey)
---------------------

A hulking brute, this shadow fey towers over his fellows and
wields massive weapons. Patches of his body are swallowed by
inky blackness that writhes and crawls, distorting his form in
places, and his eyes are hollow black pits.

Shadow fey guardians are massive creatures trained and bred
for battle. They appear as massive versions of shadow fey, but the
stuff of shadow corrupts them even more than their brethren,
expanding their size and power to an ogrish strength. Patches of
pitch black shadow swallow parts of their body and crawl about,
revealing and obscuring more by inches at a time. They stand
nearly 10 feet tall and weigh over 700 pounds.

Guardians are fanatically loyal to their superiors. Employed
as house guards or even personal bodyguards for important
shadow fey, guardians are unshakable in their duty. The shadow
corruption reaches into their minds and souls, so that not even
powerful magic can bend their hearts or break their resolve.
Guardians aren’t independent thinkers, but they discharge their
duty with single-minded dedication.
