Forest Hunter (Shadow Fey)
--------------------------

The shadows flicker slightly, and that’s the only warning before
a hail of arrows erupts from the concealed, black-skinned elf
hidden in the gloom.

Dressed in exquisitely wrought mail and leather jerkins, forest
hunters are even more lithe and graceful than most shadow fey.
Physically, only their mannerisms and skills setting them apart
from other shadow fey—usually too late.

Forest hunters roam the deep woods connected to shadow
roads, as well as the dark reflections within the plane of
Shadows. They are skilled trackers and stalkers, hunting animals
and more dangerous game. Many forest hunters serve in the
Wild Hunt, and a hunter that has at one time ridden at the Lord
of the Hunt’s side is afforded great respect, even fear, because of
the common belief that such a hunter can implore the Lord of
the Hunt to notice an enemy.
