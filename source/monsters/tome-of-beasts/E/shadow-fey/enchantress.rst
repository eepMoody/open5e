Enchantress (Shadow Fey)
------------------------

This ravishing shadow fey woman moves with alluring grace.
Her voice rings like a bell, and in her hearing worldly cares and
sorrows melt away.

Beyond even great physical beauty, the sheer presence of a
shadow fey enchantress can lay the most stalwart foes low.
Enchantresses live up to their name; almost universally female,
they are beautiful beyond compare. Only if they wish it could
they ever be mistaken for common shadow fey.

Enchantresses are also powerful spellcasters who infuse their
words and manner with the beguiling power of shadow to turn
enemies against one another with a few words and a deadly
smile. They augment the force of their minds with fey-wrought
blades, infusing their weapons with power that shreds their
victims’ psyche as well as their flesh.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The shadow fey makes two rapier attacks.

**Rapier.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage plus 17 (5d6) psychic
damage.

**Beguiling Whispers (recharge 5-6).** The shadow fey speaks
sweet words to a creature she can see within 60 feet, that can
hear the enchantress. The creature must succeed on a DC 15
Charisma saving throw or be :ref:`srd:charmed` for 1
minute. While charmed in this way, the
creature has disadvantage on Wisdom
and Charisma saving throws made to resist
spells cast by the enchantress.

**Leadership (recharges after a Short or Long
Rest).** The enchantress can utter a special
command or warning to a creature she can
see within 30 feet of her. The creature must
not be hostile to the enchantress and it must
be able to hear (the command is inaudible to
all but the target creature). For 1 minute, the
creature adds a d4 to its attack rolls and saving
throws. A creature can benefit from only one
enchantress’s Leadership at a time. This effect ends if
the enchantress is incapacitated.
