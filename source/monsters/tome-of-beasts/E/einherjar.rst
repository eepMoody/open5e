Einherjar
---------

*Stout bearded warriors with golden auras, the einherjar wear
chain mail and carry two-handed battle axes and oaken shields—
their badges and symbols are all different, and it is said no two
braid their beards quite alike.*

As the spirits of warriors chosen by the valkyries and brought to
Valhalla to fight for the gods against the giants, the einherjar are
great warriors who eat and drink their fill of boar and mead each
night, then spend their days preparing for Ragnarok. Some of
this is combat training, and other portions are raids against the
Jotun giants and thursir giants, to try their strength. Regardless
of how often they are slain, the einherjar reappear each morning
in Odin’s hall, so they have no fear of death, and their courage
shames others into greater bravery.

**Defenders of the Mortal World.** From time to time,
the ravenfolk guide a troop of the einherjar against some
of Loki’s minions or the servants of Boreas. These raids are
often small battles, but the einherjar know they are only
delaying the inevitable rise of the world serpent and its many
evil spawn. This drives them to greater efforts against giants,
demons, lindwurms, and other evil creatures, but the einherjar
themselves are not exactly saintly. They drink, they carouse, they
slap and tickle and brag and boast and fart with the loudest and
most boastful of Asgardians. Unlike most extraplanar creatures,
they are very human, if somewhat larger than life.

**Fear Dragons.** The einherjar have a notable soft spot for the
ratatosk and the ravenfolk, but they are superstitiously fearful
of dragons of all kinds. They sometimes hunt or ride or carouse
with the fey lords and ladies, especially the Bear King, the Snow
Queen, and the Lord of the Hunt.

**Never Speak to the Living.** In theory, the einherjar are
forbidden from speaking with the living: they must pass their
words through a valkyrie, a ratatosk, one of the ravenfolk, or
other races allied with Asgard. In practice, this rule is often
flouted, though if Loki’s servants notice it, they can dismiss any
einherjar back to Valhalla for a day.
