Hag, Red
--------

*An elder race—much older than the elves, and as old as the dragons,
they claim—red hags are the most cunning and longest-lived of the
hags, having a lifespan of more than a thousand years.*

**Beautiful and Strong.** Unlike their hag kin, red hags are not
horrid to look upon, and most are considered comely in their
own right. Few know anything about them, and the hags do little
to enlighten them, preferring their seclusion.

**Tied to Nature.** The hags have a deep connection with
all elements of nature, and they often make their homes in
deep forests, in caves, or alongside coastlines.

**Blood Magic.** Because of their close connection to nature,
red hags often serve as druids. Within their druidic circles,
however, they practice blood sacrifices and perform ritualistic
blood magic—both to slake their craving for humanoid blood,
but also as a means to venerate Hecate, goddesses of dark magic.
Red hags also favor the cleric and wizard classes; few ever seek a
martial path. The ancient hags all answer to a hierarchy.
