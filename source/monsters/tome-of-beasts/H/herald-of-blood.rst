Herald of Blood
---------------

*The heralds of blood are 20-foot-tall giants with bruised purple
skin, and wart-like blood blisters that deform their features. They
often wear cowled robes over golden armor streaked with black
or green, and their staves of power are always ebony and mithral,
embedded with precious stones.*

As powerful sorcerers and blood mages, heralds of blood are
without peer. They enjoy enslaving ogres and giants whenever
possible, though they make do with lesser slaves when they must.

**Dark Prophets.** Their stirring speeches proclaim that the end
times are fast approaching, and their followers must prepare
for a bloody reckoning. Behind their charismatic preaching,
the heralds of blood serve elder earth gods that demand blood
sacrifices, especially dark druid orders devoted to human hunts
and the murder of innocents. They have the power to grant
strength, lust, and vitality—or to wither those who cross them.

**Blood Magic Vortexes.** In their true form, which they keep
hidden except in battle, heralds of blood are swirling vortexes of
blood, bone, and raw magical power. They feed on ley line magic
and the black blood of the earth as much as on flesh and blood.

effects of the attack.

**Gift of Blood.** As an action, the herald of blood can transform
any fey, human, or goblin into a red hag, if the target willingly
accepts this transformation.

**Grant Blood Rage.** As a bonus action, the herald of blood can
grant a single living creature blood rage, giving it advantage
on attacks for 3 rounds. At the end of this time, the target
gains 1 level of exhaustion and suffers 13 (2d12) necrotic
damage from blood loss.

**Humanoid Form.** A herald of blood can assume a humanoid
form at will as a bonus action, and dismiss this form at will.

**Melting Touch.** When a herald of blood scores a critical hit or
starts its turn with a foe grappled, it can dissolve one metal or
wood item of its choosing in that foe's possession. A mundane
item is destroyed automatically; a magical item survives if its
owner makes a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw.

or be grappled by the herald of blood (escape DC 16). While
grappled this way, the creature takes 39 (6d12) acid damage at
the start of each of the herald’s turns. The herald can have any
number of creatures grappled this way.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A herald of blood can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from

its turn.

terrifying burst of eldritch power. All creatures within 100 feet
and in direct line of sight of the herald take 32 (5d12) necrotic

blinded. Targets that make a successful DC 15 Charisma saving
throw are not blinded and gain only 1 level of exhaustion.
