Blood Hag
---------

*This bent-backed crone has long, leathery arms and cruel,
flesh‑shearing talons. Her face is a misshapen mass of leathery flesh
with a bulbous nose, like a gnarled knot on an old oak tree.*

**Vampiric Origins.** Blood hags have long skulked on the
fringes of society. The first blood hags appeared when a :ref:`tob:red-hag`
mated with a mad vampire archmage­­—their offspring became
the first blood hags. Many more followed.

**Face Stealers.** Blood hags prey on mankind, stealing their
seed to propagate, their blood to satisfy their insatiable thirst,
and their faces as trophies of these short-lived and bloody trysts.

**Worm Hair.** A blood hag’s hair is a morass of wriggling worms,
ever thirsty for fresh blood.

**Blood Sense.** A blood hag automatically senses the blood of
living creatures within 90 feet and can pinpoint their locations
within 30 feet.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The hag’s innate spellcasting ability
is Charisma (spell save DC 15). She can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:disguise-self`, :ref:`srd:knock`, :ref:`srd:minor-illusion`, :ref:`srd:misty-step`, :ref:`srd:pass-without-trace`, :ref:`srd:protection-from-evil-and-good`, :ref:`srd:tongues`, :ref:`srd:water-breathing`

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The blood hag makes two claw attacks and one
blood-drinking hair attack.

**Blood-Drinking Hair.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10
ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (3d8 + 5) piercing damage and a Medium
or smaller target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 15). A grappled
creature takes 13 (2d8 + 3) necrotic damage at the start of
the hag’s turns, and the hag heals half as many hit points. The
hag gains excess healing as temporary hit points. The hag can
grapple one or two creatures at a time. Also see Face Peel.

**Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 19 (4d6 + 5) slashing damage.

**Call the Blood.** The blood hag targets a living creature within
30 feet that she detects with her blood sense and makes the
target bleed uncontrollably. The target must make a successful
DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer one of the effects
listed below. A target that saves successfully cannot be
affected by this hag's ability again for 24 hours.

1. **Blood Choke Curse.** The target’s mouth fills with blood,
   preventing any speech or spellcasting with verbal
   components for 1 minute.
2. **Blood Eye.** The target’s eyes well up with bloody tears. The
   target is :ref:`srd:blinded` for 1 minute.
3. **Heart Like Thunder.** The target hears only the rushing of
   blood and their thumping heart. They are :ref:`srd:deafened` for 1 minute.
4. **Rupturing Arteries.** The victim suffers 7 (2d6) slashing
   damage as its veins and arteries burst open. The target
   repeats the saving throw at the beginning of each of its
   turns. It takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage if the saving throw
   fails, but the effect ends on a successful save.

**Face Peel.** The blood hag peels the face off one grappled foe.
The target must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. If the
saving throw fails, the face is torn off; the target takes 38 (8d6 +
10) slashing damage and is :ref:`srd:stunned` until the start of the hag’s
next turn. If the save succeeds, the target takes half damage
and isn’t stunned. :ref:`srd:heal`, :ref:`srd:regenerate`, or comparable magic
restores the stolen features; other curative magic forms a mass
of scar tissue. The peeled-off face is a tiny, animated object
(per the spell—20 HP, AC 18, no attack, Str 4, Dex 18) under
the hag’s control. It retains the former owner’s memories and
personality. Blood hags keep such faces as trophies, but they
can also wear someone’s face to gain advantage on Charisma
(Deception) checks made to imitate the face’s former owner.
