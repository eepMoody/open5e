Mirror Hag
----------

*A mirror hag forces an unsuspecting creature to reflect on its own
superficiality by gazing into the hag’s horrible face.*

**Hideous Hex.** Until a creature can see past the hag’s
deformities, it suffers the pain of a disfigured life. Some mirror
hags do this for the betterment of all, but most do it because
causing pain amuses them.

**Warped Features.** Mirror hags are hunchbacked, with
growths and lesions covering their skin. Their joints misalign,
and the extremities of their bones press against their skin.
However, it is their faces that inspire legends: the blackest moles
sprouting long white hairs, noses resembling half-eaten carrots,
and eyes mismatched in size, color, and alignment. If a creature
recoils from a mirror hag’s looks, she bestows her reconfiguring
curse on it.

**Mirror Covens.** Mirror hags can form a coven with two other
hags. Generally, mirror hags only form covens with other mirror
hags, but from time to time a mirror hag will join a coven of
witches or green hags.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The hag’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). She
can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material
components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:disguise-self`, :ref:`srd:inflict-wounds` (4d10), :ref:`srd:message`, :ref:`srd:ray-of-enfeeblement`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:detect-thoughts`, :ref:`srd:dispel-magic`, :ref:`srd:lightning-bolt`, :ref:`srd:locate-creature`, :ref:`srd:shillelagh`, :ref:`srd:stinking-cloud`, :ref:`srd:teleport`

**Magic Resistance.** The hag has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

**Confounding Ugliness.** When confronting a mirror hag at any
range, a creature must make a choice at the start of each of its
turns: either avert its eyes so that it has disadvantage on attack
rolls against the hag until the start of its next turn, or look at
the hag and make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure
on the saving throw leaves the character :ref:`srd:stunned` until the start
of its next turn.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** A mirror hag can use its Reconfiguring Curse and
make one melee attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
21 (4d8 + 3) piercing damage, or 39 (8d8 + 3) piercing damage
against a stunned target.

**Quarterstaff.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

**Reconfiguring Curse.** The mirror hag curses a living creature
within 60 feet, giving it beastly or hideous features. The
target of the reconfiguring curse must succeed on a DC 15
Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 Charisma damage. A
successful save renders the target immune to further uses of
that hag’s curse for 24 hours.
