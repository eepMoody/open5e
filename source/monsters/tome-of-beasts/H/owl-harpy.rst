Harpy, Owl
----------

*This winged woman’s face is wreathed
in a headdress of feathers; her
luminous eyes and aquiline
nose lend beauty to her
feral demeanor. Her
sharp, taloned
feet seem even
more inhuman by comparison.*

**Harpy Queens.** An owl harpy is a
queen among her kind, possessing
superior grace and intelligence and an
owl's predatory instinct and savage appetite.
Owl harpies never grow hair, only feathers, which
often wreathe their faces and crown their heads like a
headdress. Their taloned feet are strong and razor sharp.
They are much stronger fliers than lesser harpies; they
swoop and hover in mid-air with ease to tear their prey
apart. They are found in temperate climates as well as in
deserts and jungles.

**Noctural Magic.** Owl harpies practice a rare, potent magic
associated with darkness and the night. They can counter most
light sources easily. So refined is their hearing that neither
darkness nor invisibility detracts from their ability to hunt their
quarry. Their acute hearing also means that thunder attacks
distress them.

**Servants of Alquam.** Owl harpies are natural (if irredeemably
evil) bards thanks to their sharp wits, and most are zealous
followers of Alquam, demon lord of night. Less common but not
unheard of are owl harpy oracles, scholars, and collectors. These
savants are known to exchange their knowledge and insights for
companionship or for unusual gifts and treasures.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The owl harpy makes two claw attacks and two
talon attacks.

**Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.

**Talons.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

**Hovering Darkness.** An owl harpy that hovers in flight
can shake a fine, magical dander from her wings over a
creature within 20 feet and directly below her. The creature
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall
unconscious and be poisoned for 10 minutes. It wakes up if it
takes damage or if a creature uses an action to shake it awake,
but waking up doesn’t end the poisoning.

**Luring Song.** The owl harpy sings a magical melody. Every
humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear
the song must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must use a bonus
action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can
stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy becomes
incapacitated.

While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and
ignores the songs of other harpies. A charmed target that
is more than 5 feet away from the harpy must move at its
highest rate (including dashing, if necessary) along the most
direct route to get within 5 feet of the harpy. The charmed
creature doesn’t maneuver to avoid opportunity attacks, but it
can repeat the saving throw every time it takes damage from
anything other than the harpy. It also repeats the saving throw
before entering damaging terrain (lava or a pit, for example), if
the most direct route includes a dangerous space. A creature
also repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. A
successful saving throw ends the effect on that creature and
makes the creature immune to this harpy’s song for 24 hours.
