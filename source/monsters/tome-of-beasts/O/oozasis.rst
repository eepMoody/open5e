Oozasis
-------

*The oasis appears as an idyllic desert respite, offering water,
shade, and even perhaps edible fruit and nuts in the trees above.*

**Mockmire.** The oozasis, or oasis ooze, is also known as a
mockmire in other climates. It mimics a peaceful, pristine
watering hole to draw in unsuspecting prey. An oozasis cycles
seemingly at random between wakefulness and hibernation.

**Quest Givers.** Within its odd physiology stirs an ancient
mind with an inscrutable purpose. Far from being a mere
mindless sludge, its fractured intelligence occasionally
awakens to read the thoughts of visitors. At these times, it tries
to coerce them into undertaking quests for cryptic reasons.

**Ancient Minds.** Some tales claim these creatures preserve
the memories of mad wizards from dead empires, or that they
have unimaginably ancient, inhuman origins.

**Amorphous.** The oozasis can move through a space as narrow
as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

**Mirage.** As a bonus action, the oozasis can create a mirage
around itself to lure victims toward it while disguising its true
nature. This functions as the mirage arcane spell (save DC
16) but is nonmagical, and therefore can’t be detected using
detect magic or similar magic, and can’t be dispelled.

**Waters of Unfathomable Compulsion.** Any creature that
drinks the water of an oozasis or eats fruit from the plants
growing in it has a dream (as the spell, save DC 16) the next
time it sleeps. In this dream, the oozasis places a compulsion
to carry out some activity as a torrent of images and
sensations. When the creature awakens, it is affected by a geas
spell (save DC 16, cast as a 7th-level spell) in addition to the
effects of dream.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack:** The oozasis makes two pseudopod attacks.

**Pseudopod.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one
creature. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6)
acid damage, and a target that’s Large or smaller is grappled
(escape DC 16) and restrained until the grapple ends. The
oozasis has two pseudopods, each of which can grapple one
target at a time.

**Engulf.** The oozasis engulfs creatures grappled by it. An
engulfed creature can’t breathe, is restrained, is no longer
grappled, has total cover against attacks and other effects
outside the oozasis, takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start
of each of the oozasis’s turns, and is subject to the oozasis’s
Waters of Unfathomable Compulsion trait. The creature takes
no damage if the oozasis chooses not to inflict any. When
the oozasis moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An
engulfed creature can escape by using an action and making
a successful DC 16 Strength check. On a success, the creature
enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the oozasis.

**Vapors of Tranquility or Turmoil (Recharges after a Short or
Long Rest).** The oozasis sublimates its waters into a vapor that
fills a disk centered on the oozasis, 60 feet in radius, and 10
feet thick. All creatures in the area are affected by either the
calm emotions spell or the confusion spell (save DC 16). The
oozasis chooses which effect to use, and it must be the same
for all creatures.
