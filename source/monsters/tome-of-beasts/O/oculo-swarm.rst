Oculo Swarm
-----------

*This collection of hundreds of eyes floats along, trailing ganglia and
dripping caustic fluid that sizzles when it hits the ground.*

**Failed Experiment.** An oculo swarm results from an
experiment to create a live scrying sensor that went poorly.
Once set loose, these horrors attain a form of distributed
self‑awareness. Exactly what motivates them is unknown,
except that they are driven to survive.

**Flesh Stealers.** A weakened oculo swarm can reinvigorate
itself by tearing fresh eyes from almost any type of living
creature. If a badly depleted oculus swarm escapes from battle—
and they seldom fight to the death unless cornered—it attacks
lone creatures or weak groups until the mass of gore-spattered
eyeballs is replenished. The more dismembered eyeballs the
swarm contains, the more powerful its paralyzing resonance
field becomes.

**Single Eye Scouts.** The entire swarm sees what any single
member sees. Before attacking or even entering a potentially
dangerous area, individual eyes scout ahead for prospective
victims or dangerous foes. A lone eye has no offensive capability
and only 1 hp. It can travel only 100 feet away from the main
swarm, and it must return to the swarm within an hour or it dies.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and
vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening at
least 2 inches square. The swarm can’t regain hit points or
gain temporary hit points.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Eye Extraction.** Every creature that occupies the same space as
the swarm must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw
or become temporarily :ref:`srd:blinded` as their eyes strain from their
sockets. This blindness lasts for as long as the affected creature
remains in the same space as the oculus; it ends at the end
of the blinded creature’s turn if the creature is out of the
oculus’s space. Also, any cure spell cast on the blinded creature
ends the temporary blindness, but not restoration spells. If a
creature that’s already temporarily blinded is targeted again
by eye extraction and fails the saving throw, that creature
becomes permanently blind as its eyes are pulled from their
sockets to join the swarm (causing 1d8 piercing damage).
Success on either saving throw renders that creature immune
to eye extraction for 24 hours (but it still doesn’t recover its
sight until it gets out of the swarm). An oculo swarm with 50 or
fewer hit points can’t use this ability.

**Gaze (recharge 5-6).** The swarm targets every creature in its
space with a gaze attack. The swarm can choose one of two
effects for the attack: :ref:`srd:confusion` or :ref:`srd:hold-person`. Every target in
the swarm’s space is affected unless it makes a successful DC
14 Charisma saving throw. Even creatures that avert their eyes
or are blind can be affected by an oculus swarm’s gaze. The
confusion or hold person effect lasts 1d4 rounds.
