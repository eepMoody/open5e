Qwyllion
--------

*These hideous, reeking creatures resemble toothless, cadaverous
hags, their large eyes glowing with unearthly green light, and their
fingers tipped with ragged claws.*

**Twisted Nymphs.** Qwyllion (the name means “polluter” in
Old Elvish) are nymphs who have been twisted by the corrupted
mana of magical wastelands or warped alchemical experiments
into baleful versions of their former selves.

**Frighten Animals.** Besides making them hideously ugly, the
transformation leaves them with a deadly gaze attack and the
ability to dominate a living creature with a mere glance. Animals
refuse to approach within 20 feet of them.

**Goblin Mercenaries.** Qwyllion and their dominated thralls
and enslaved specters are sometimes engaged by goblin sorcerers
and evil mages to guard desecrated temples and despoiled
gardens. The terms and payments for these arrangements vary
wildly from one qwyllion to the next. Anyone who dares to
employ a qwyllion must be constantly vigilant, because these
creatures are prone to renege on any agreement eventually.

**Disruptive.** Because of the qwyllion’s nauseating
nature, spellcasters have disadvantage on concentration
checks while within 40 feet of the qwyllion.

**Nauseating Aura.** The qwyllion is nauseatingly corrupt. Any
creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the qwyllion must
succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned
for 1d8 rounds. If a creature that’s already poisoned by this
effect fails the saving throw again, it becomes incapacitated
instead, and a creature already incapacitated by the qwyllion
drops to 0 hit points if it fails the saving throw. A successful
saving throw renders a creature immune to the effect for 24
hours. Creatures dominated by the qwyllion are immune to
this effect.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The qwyllion uses its deadly gaze if it can, and
makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 24 (3d12 + 5) slashing damage.

**Deadly Gaze (recharge 5-6).** The qwyllion turns its gaze
against a single creature within 20 feet of the qwyllion. The
target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or
take 16 (3d8 + 3) necrotic damage and be incapacitated until
the start of the qwyllion’s next turn. A humanoid slain by a
qwyllion’s death gaze rises 2d4 hours later as a specter under
the qwyllion’s control.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The qwyllion’s innate casting ability
is Charisma (spell save DC 14). She can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no material components:

**3/day each:** dominate person (range 20 feet), shatter
