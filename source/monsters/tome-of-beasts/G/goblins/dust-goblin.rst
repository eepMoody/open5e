Goblin, Dust
------------

*A ragged creature
emerges from the
sand. Its spindly
frame is encased in
a hodge‑podge of armor
scraps and rusted weapons. A
long, hooked nose protrudes
over a wide mouth filled with
sharp teeth.*

Dust goblins vary greatly in
size and appearance, although
they are universally scrawny, bony,
and lanky. They seem to suffer
from malnutrition even when
in perfect health, a perception
reinforced by the way their bellies
distend after they’ve gorged
themselves on flesh. Their skin
is always dry and cracked,
ranging from dusky gray to
dark green in color.

**Rule the Wastelands.**
Dust goblins are twisted
creatures, tainted by many
generations of life in a blasted wasteland. After a magical war
devastated the dust goblins’ homeland, they rose to become
the most dominant inhabitants. They inhabit ancient ruins and
ambush travelers who stray too close to their borders.

**Twisted Minds.** The lingering magical energy saturating
the wastes of their home, coupled with the harsh conditions
in which they scratch out a living, have tainted the minds of all
dust goblins. Their thinking is alien and unfathomable to most
creatures. Whereas most goblins are cowardly, dust goblins don’t
seem to experience fear. To the contrary, they enjoy wearing skull
helmets and using ghostly whistles to frighten foes.
Owing to this alien mindset, dust goblins get along
disturbingly well with aberrations. The creatures often forge
alliances and work together for mutual benefit, while making
their unnerving mark on communal lairs.

Dust goblins range from 2 to 4 feet tall, and weigh between 20
and 80 pounds.
