Gremlin, Rum
------------

*Found on docks and ships, these small, pot-bellied
monstrosities have bright green hair, orange eyes, and a
drunken stare. They are only a foot tall and weigh ten lb, but
they are renowned for causing mischief far beyond their tiny
size. Their mouths are filled with razor-sharp teeth.*

**Drunken Aura.** Rum gremlins make their homes near
the docks of seaside towns and some are known to stow
away on ships. Each rum gremlin radiates a magic aura
causing drunkenness affecting any creatures in the area.
Those affected find it difficult to stay on their feet and
may become sick from the effect.

**Sailor Victims.** The little horrors often create
distracting sounds and small traps. Rum gremlins prey
on sailors and dockworkers, working in groups to swarm
affected victims who they drag into their lairs below docks
or in the holds of ships. They also take great delight in
the collateral damage their magic can wreak, frequently
sparking accusations and quarrels in places they inhabit
before picking off isolated victims.

**Rat Friends.** Rum gremlins are often found with rat swarms
or doppelrats they have trained to help protect their nests. The
sound of bells drives rum gremlins into a rage and they will go to
great lengths to destroy the source of their torment.

**Aura of Drunkenness.** A rum gremlin radiates an aura of
drunkenness to a radius of 20 feet. Every creature that starts
its turn in the aura must make a successful DC 12 Constitution
saving throw against poison or be poisoned for one hour.
Creatures that have drunk any alcohol during the previous
hour have disadvantage on the saving throw. While affected by
this poison, a creature falls prone if it tries to move more than
half its speed during a turn.
