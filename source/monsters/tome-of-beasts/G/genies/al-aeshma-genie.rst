Al-Aeshma Genie
---------------

A savage parody of a djinni, an al-Aeshma’s lower half is composed
of scorching winds and desert sand.

**Sand Djinnis.** The al-Aeshma are former djinn and share the
same powers, albeit in a darker style. Their skin is black as pitch,
and their whirlwind form includes much dust and sand. Only
radiant or fire damage can slay them entirely—otherwise the
desert sand flows to seal their wounds and reattach severed limbs.

**Obligation of Wishes.** Granting three wishes to a mortal is
a sacred and serious obligation among the genies, referred to
as being wishbound. The Lords of Air mandate this as celestial
law, and many believe that a djinni cannot refuse to grant a wish.
Certainly the consequences of disobedience are dire.
Those djinn who decline to grant a wish, for any reason, are
stripped of their wish power and handed to efreeti for 1,001
years of torture and debasement. Those that survive are
banished to wander the Material Plane.

**Unforgiven.** No al-Aeshma has ever been forgiven.
Their punishment drives them mad, and makes
them anything but contrite. Al-Aeshma are a feral,
mocking scourge to all other genies, even efreeti,
for they know many secrets and their hearts lust
for revenge.

**Challenge** 9 (5,000 XP)

**Air Hatred.** The al-Aeshma has advantage on attack rolls
against airborne opponents.

**Bound.** The al-Aeshma must always be anchored to the earth.
Even in gaseous form or sandstorm form, part of it must always
touch the ground. The al-Aeshma’s maximum altitude while
flying is 50 ft. If it is not touching, it gains vulnerability to
lightning and thunder.

**Elemental Demise.** When an al-Aeshma dies, its body
disintegrates into a swirling spray of coarse sand, leaving
behind equipment it was wearing or carrying.

**Ill Wind.** As a bonus action when in gaseous form, the
al‑Aeshma can befoul its space with a choking scent. When the
al-Aeshma moves through another creature’s space in gaseous
form, the creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution
saving throw or be :ref:`srd:incapacitated` until the end of its next
turn. Ill Wind lasts until the al-Aeshma leaves gaseous form or
chooses to end the ability as a bonus action.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The al-Aeshma’s innate spellcasting ability
is Charisma (spell save DC 17). It can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:detect-evil-and-good`, :ref:`srd:detect-magic`, :ref:`srd:thunderwave`

**3/day each:** *destroy food and water* (as :ref:`srd:create-food-and-water`,
but makes food and drink unpalatable), :ref:`srd:tongues`, :ref:`srd:wind-walk`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:creation`, :ref:`srd:gaseous-form`, :ref:`srd:insect-plague`, :ref:`srd:invisibility`,
:ref:`srd:major-image`

**Regeneration.** The al-Aeshma regains 10 hit points at the start
of its turn. If it takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn’t
function at the start of its next turn. The al‑Aeshma dies only if
it starts its turn at 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The al-Aeshma makes three scimitar attacks.

**Scimitar.** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage, plus 3 (1d6) necrotic
damage.

**Dust Devil.** A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of sand
magically forms on a point the al-Aeshma can see within
120 feet of it. The dust devil lasts as long as the al-Aeshma
maintains concentration (as if a spell). Any creature but the
al-Aeshma that enters the dust devil must succeed on a DC 18
Strength saving throw or be :ref:`srd:restrained` by it; any number of
creatures may be restrained this way. At the start of a restrained
creature’s turn, it takes 7 (2d6) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6)
necrotic damage. The al-Aeshma can move the dust devil up
to 60 feet as an action; restrained creatures move with it. The
dust devil ends if the al-Aeshma loses sight of it. A creature can
use its action to free a creature restrained by the dust devil,
including itself, by making a DC 18 Strength check. If the check
succeeds, it moves to the nearest space outside the dust devil.
