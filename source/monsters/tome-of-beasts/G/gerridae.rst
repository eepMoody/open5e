Gerridae
--------

*These large water-striding insects resemble a strange cross between
camels and wingless, long-legged locusts. A rider can comfortably
sit in the large hollow in the small of their backs, even at high
speeds or on choppy water. Riders use the gerridae’s long, looping
antennae to steer.*

**Elvish Water Steeds.** Known by their Elvish name, these
large fey water striders were enchanted and bred by the elves in
ages past, when their explorers roamed the world. Elven mages
started with normal water striders and—through elaborate
magical procedures and complex cross-breeding programs—
transformed the mundane water striders into large, docile
mounts. They can cross large bodies of water quickly while
carrying a humanoid rider, even in windy conditions.

**Sturdy Mounts.** A gerridae can carry up to 300 pounds of rider
and gear before being encumbered, or 600 while encumbered.

**Fond of Sweet Scents.** Gerridae can sometimes be distracted
by appealing scents, such as apple blossom or fresh hay. They are
also fond of raw duck and swan.

**Bred to the Saddle.** Gerridae do not take any penalties to their
movement or speed due to encumbrance or carrying a single
rider.

**Waterborne.** Any gerridae can run while on the surface of
water, but not while on land or climbing. They treat stormy
water as normal rather than difficult terrain. A gerridae takes
one point of damage for every hour spent on dry land.
