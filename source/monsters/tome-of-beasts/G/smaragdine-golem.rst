Golem, Smaragdine
-----------------

*This large statue of emerald-green crystal has a humanoid body
with the head of an ibis. Tiny symbols and runes are etched into it,
and portions are inlaid with bits of gold.*

**Occult Initiates.** Smaragdine golems are crafted by disciples
of occult esoterica to guard their secret meeting halls, sacred
texts, and the arcane books of power.

**Emerald Body.** Though they seem to be made entirely
of emeralds (and some are used in their construction),
a smaragdine golem’s body is closer to enchanted glass
than to gemstones, a sad truth that has disappointed
many plunderers.

**A Maker’s Privilege.** Though smaragdine
golems are sometimes given to powerful mages, scholars,
theurgists, and hierophants as a token of esteem, they are always
subject first to the magic and orders of their creators.

**Constructed Nature.** A golem doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The golem’s weapon attacks are magical.

**Absorb Magic.** As a bonus action, the golem targets any
creature, object, or magical effect within 10 feet of it. The
golem chooses a spell already cast on the target. If the spell is
of 3rd level or lower, the golem absorbs the spell and it ends. If
the spell is of 4th level or higher, the golem must make a check
with a +9 modifier. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a
successful check, the golem absorbs the spell and it ends. The
golem’s body glows when it absorbs a spell, as if under the
effect of a light spell. A smaragdine golem can only hold one
absorbed spell at a time.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The golem makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 25 (4d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

**Release Spell.** The golem can release an absorbed spell effect
as a blast of green energy, which blasts out as a sphere
centered on the golem with a radius of 10 feet per level of
the absorbed spell. All creatures in the area of effect other
than the golem takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage per level of
the absorbed spell, or half damage with a successful DC 18
Dexterity saving throw. Creatures that fail the saving throw are
also blinded until the end of the golem’s next turn.
