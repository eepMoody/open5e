Garroter Crab
-------------

*These aggressive, blue-black freshwater crabs inhabit rivers and
streams, scuttling along the muddy terrain in search of prey.*

**Strangling Claws.** Garroter crabs are named for their
abnormal right claws, which have evolved over time to strangle
prey like a barbed whip.

**Clacking Hordes.** Their long whip-claw is lined with powerful
muscles and joints at the beginning, middle, and end that give
it great flexibility. During mating season, thousands of garroter
crabs congregate in remote riverbanks and marshes, and the
males whip their shells with a clacking sound to attract a mate.

**Small Prey.** Garroter crabs prey on rodents, cats, and other
small animals caught by the riverbank.
