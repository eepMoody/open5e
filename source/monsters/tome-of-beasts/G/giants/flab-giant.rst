Giant, Flab
-----------

*This obese, bell-shaped giant is blemished by ulcers, enlarged
veins, and fungal rashes. Though it stumbles about on a pair
of short, calloused legs, it moves its weight with dangerous
potential, catching many foes off-guard.*

**Great Girth.** Whether as a result of a centuries-past
curse or a gradual adaptation to an easy-going
existence, the flab giant (one of the shortest breeds
of giant) is gigantic in width rather than height
and almost comical in its simple life.

Too obese to effectively grasp
weapons in its chubby
fingers, a flab giant uses its
great mass to deadly effect,
overrunning or grabbing
opponents and then sitting on
them to crush them to death,
swatting away missiles,
and simply putting up
with the damage of melee
attacks until its victims stop
struggling and it gets up to
see if they’re dead yet.

**Efficient Foragers.** Flab giants are the least
active of giant types, spending most of their waking
hours resting, napping, and sleeping, and only devote
a short period each day to listlessly shuffling about,
scrounging for food. Because a flab giant can eat
practically anything, it doesn’t have to roam
far to find enough food to sustain its bulk,
so it is rarely found far from its crude lair.

**Knotted Skins.** Flab giants wear only
scraps of clothing made of loosely knotted
skins, leaving most of their stretch-marked
and discolored skin exposed. Favored pelts
include bear and human. A flab giant stands eight
to ten feet tall and weighs 1,000 to 1,500 pounds.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The giant makes two slam attacks. If both hit, the
target is grappled (escape DC 15), and the flab giant uses its
squatting pin against the target as a bonus action.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

**Squatting Pin.** The flab giant squats atop the target, pinning it to
the ground, where it is grappled and restrained (escape DC 17).
The flab giant is free to attack another target, but the restrained
creatures are released if it moves from its current space. As long
as the giant does not move from the spot, it can maintain the
squatting pin on up to two Medium-sized or smaller creatures.
A creature suffers 9 (1d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage every time it
starts its turn restrained by a squatting pin.
