Thursir Giant
-------------

*Heavily armored and carrying two rune-marked hammers, a
thursir giant’s reddish hair and beard are often plaited in the style
of an enormous dwarf.*

**Forge Masters.** Greedy and aggressively competitive, thursir
dwell in vast caverns under frozen mountains where they labor
to forge chains, armor, and massive engines of war. Thursir
giants have a natural affinity for metalworking. Any armor or
weapons forged by a thursir giant are of the highest quality and
can fetch double the usual price for such an item.

**Enormous Appetites.** When not toiling at the forge,
these giants entertain themselves with gluttonous feasts and
boisterous wrestling competitions, or raid human settlements
for food and valuables.

**Hearth Rune Priestesses.** Female priestesses have a much
higher standing in their society than other female thursir
giants, who are treated shabbily. Most female thursir giants are
drudges, considered fit only for child-bearing and menial labor.
However, male thursir are makers, warrior, and metalworkers,
while women make up the bulk of their priesthood and
spellcasters. As priests and casters, they are valued advisors and
held in high regard—or at least very valuable property.

Thursir stand nine feet tall and weigh 600 lb.

**Cast Iron Stomach.** The giant can consume half of its weight in

that would give it the poisoned condition. Poisonous and
spoiled foodstuffs are common in a thursir lair.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The giant makes two warhammer attacks.

**Warhammer.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 40/160 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

**Runic Blood (3/day).** Thursir giants can inscribe the thurs rune
on a weapon. A creature hit by the weapon takes an additional
1d8 lightning damage, and the target can’t take reactions until
the start of its next turn. The thurs rune lasts for one hour, or
for three hits, whichever comes first.
