Desert Giant
------------

*The towering woman rises up from the desert sand. Her pale brown
robe almost perfectly matches the gritty terrain, and her roughly
textured skin is a rich walnut brown.*

Desert giants live in arid wastelands that were once a thriving
giant empire. Their rich brown skin is rough-textured, and they
dress in light robes matching the color of the sand, accented
(when they aren’t trying to blend in) with brightly colored head
cloths and sashes. Beneath their robes, the desert giants paint
or tattoo their skin with intricate designs in a riot of colors that
outsiders rarely see.

**Wandering Legacy.** Desert giants subsist in the scorching
wastes by moving from oasis to oasis. They follow
herds of desert animals that they cultivate for
milk, meat, and hides, and they shun
most contact with settled people.
They can survive the blazing heat
of the high summer, because desert
giants know secret ways with relatively
plentiful water and the location of
cool, shaded caverns.

While in ages past the desert giants
lived in stationary settlements and
cities, the fall of their ancient empire
drove them into the dunes. The truth
behind their nomadic lifestyle is a
sore spot; should any outsider learn the
truth, the desert giants stop at nothing to
permanently silence the inquisitive soul.

**Keepers of the Past.** Over time, wandering
desert giants amass vast knowledge of ruins
and relics scattered across and beneath
their homeland. On rare occasions that the
tribes require something of outsiders, this
information is their most valuable commodity.
Relics of the past, or simply the location of
unplundered ruins, can purchase great advantage
for the tribe.

The designs the giants painstakingly inscribe on their bodies
tell a tale that, if woven together correctly, reveals an entire
tribe’s collected discoveries. For this reason, the desert giants
hold the bodies of their dead in sacred esteem. They go to
extraordinary lengths to recover their dead, so they can divide
the knowledge held on the deceased’s skin among other tribe
members. In the cases of desert giant elders, this hidden writing
may be equivalent to spell scrolls.
