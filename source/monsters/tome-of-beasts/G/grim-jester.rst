Grim Jester
-----------

*A skeletal cadaver bedecked in the motley attire of a fool capers
about while making jokes that mock mortality.*

**Amusing Death.** When a jester on his deathbed moves an
evil death god to laughter, the fool sometimes gains a reprieve.
becoming a grim jester, whose pranks serve to entertain the
god of death. Their purpose is to bring an end to mortal lives in
a gruesome, comic, and absurd manner. As long as such jesters
keep the death god amused, their continued unlife is assured.

**Grisly Humor.** A grim jester’s jokes are not funny to their
victims, but they offer a grim finality in combat. A killing joke
might be absurd, such as “Here is your final pineapple soul,
a parting gift, goodbye.” or sheer braggadocio such as “Your
footwork is atrocious, and your spell’s lost its focus, your party’s
no match for my hocus-pocus.” Others might be high-flown,
such as “Mortal, your time has come, the bell within your skull
does ring, ding, dong, dead.” Grim jesters are famous for grim,
bitter mockery such as “Your blood on fire, your heart pumps its
last, show me now a hero’s last gasp!” or “Odin’s raven has come
for you; the Valkyries were busy. You lose, mortal.”

A grim jester’s mockery rarely entertain the living—but gods of
death, chained angels, and demons find them quite amusing.

**Randomness.** Grim jesters often get their hands on wands of
wonder and scrolls of chaos magic. Beware the grim jester with
a deck of many things—they are quite talented in pulling cards
whose magic then applies to foes and spectators.

**Undead Nature.** A grim jester doesn’t require air, food, drink,
or sleep.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The jester’s spellcasting ability is Charisma
(spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately
cast the following spells requiring no components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:disguise-self`, :ref:`srd:grease`, :ref:`srd:inflict-wounds`, :ref:`srd:magic-mouth`, :ref:`srd:misty-step`

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:contagion`, :ref:`srd:mirror-image`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:delayed-blast-fireball`, :ref:`srd:finger-of-death`, :ref:`srd:mislead`, :ref:`srd:seeming`

**Last Laugh.** Unless it is destroyed in a
manner amusing to the god of death
that created it, the grim jester is
brought back after 1d20 days in a
place of the god’s choosing.

**Mock the Dying.** Death saving throws
made within 60 feet of the jester have
disadvantage.

**Turn Resistance.** The jester has
advantage on saving throws against
any effect that turns undead.

*Joker’s Shuffle (recharge 6).* The jester forces one Medium
or Small humanoid within 60 feet to make a DC 17 Charisma
saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the jester and the target
exchange locations via teleportation and an illusion causes
them to swap appearance: the jester looks and sounds like
the target, and the target looks and sounds like the jester. The
illusion lasts for 1 hour unless it is dismissed earlier by the
jester as a bonus action, or dispelled (DC 17).

**Killing Joke (recharge 6).** The jester performs an ancient,
nihilistic joke of necromantic power. This joke has no effect
on undead or constructs. All other creatures within 60 feet of
the jester must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. Those
that fail fall prone in a fit of deadly laughter. The laughter lasts
1d4 rounds, during which time the victim is :ref:`srd:incapacitated` and
unable to stand up from prone. At the end of its turn each
round, an incapacitated victim must make a successful DC
17 Constitution saving throw or be reduced to 0 hit points.
The laughter can be ended early by rendering the victim
unconscious or with greater restoration or comparable magic.

**Ridicule Hope (recharge 4-6).** When a spell that restores hit
points is cast within 60 feet of the jester, the jester can cause
that spell to inflict damage instead of curing it. The damage
equals the hit points the spell would have cured.
