Gnarljak
--------

*A gnarljak looks like a bear trap springs sprung to clacking life and
ready to tear flesh apart.*

**Hopping Motion.** All steel and springs, a gnarljak is easily
mistaken for a simple bear trap when lying dormant. But once
it starts hopping in pursuit of a target, it reveals its animated
nature and its only motivation: destruction of living things.

**Endless Snapping.** Gnarljaks are mindless. They do not grow
tired. They exist only to pull creatures to the ground and chew
through them, then turn around and chew through them again.

**Defensive Traps.** Some try to use gnarljaks to guard treasures
or booby-trap approaches to important locations, but their
indiscriminate biting makes quite dangerous to their owners
as well. Certain monsters such as redcaps and shadow fey use
gnarljak’s with some regularity, and gnomes are very fond of
making them part of a standard tunnel defense.
