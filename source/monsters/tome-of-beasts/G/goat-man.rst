Goat-Man
--------


*This hunched, man-like figure
lurches with a strange, half-hopping
gait. Tattered clothing hangs from
its muscled shoulders, and its legs
are those of a ram, ending in
cloven hooves.*

**Trespassers on the Rites.**
The first of the goat-men was
the victim of a powerful curse
intended to punish him for spying
on magical rites exclusive to the women of
his tribe. Admiring the grotesque result,
the Black Goat of the Woods
With a Thousand Young
adopted him as its servant,
and ensured that all who
committed the same taboo
fell to the same curse, and thus
into the Black Goat’s service.

**Bleating Speech.** A goat-man’s head is tusked, adorned with
curling ram’s horns, and its beard often drips with gore. Rows
of transparent, needle-like teeth fill its mouth; these teeth are
malformed and make clear speech impossible for goat-men,
though they understand others’ speech perfectly well.

**Serve Foul Cults.** Cultists of Shub-Niggurath or the Black
Goat in good standing are sometimes granted the services of
a goat-man. The creatures guard rituals sites, visit settlements
to capture or purchase suitable sacrifices, and perform certain
unspeakable acts with cult members to call forth ritual magic.
