Ghoul, Imperial
---------------

*An imperial ghoul stands tall and proud, its gray flesh robust and
muscled, its sharp talons stained black, and its clothing strangely
well kept. Its flickering red eyes have an intelligent, malicious
gleam.*

**Shock Troops.** Imperial ghouls are the shock troops of the
ghoul empire, and eager to expand its power and influence.
Treated like auxiliaries, they get the most difficult tasks: to
engage and hold foes while the darakhul, iron legionnaires, and
others outflank them.

**Ambitious Strivers.** Many believe that the hunger cults or
the necrophagi know some secret of transforming imperial
ghouls into iron ghouls. This rumor gives them hope of
advancement. Their power over the lesser ghouls and slaves gives
them a taste of tyranny. Because they are ambitious and always
hungry for more power, imperial ghouls are eager to prove
themselves as hunters, as warriors, and as spies.

**Immune to Sun.** Unlike a standard darakhul, an imperial ghoul
does not suffer from sunlight and feels little need to disguise its
true appearance.
