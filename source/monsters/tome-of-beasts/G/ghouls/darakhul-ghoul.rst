Ghoul, Darakhul
---------------

*In the lightless depths beneath the ground, an empire of devouring
ambition grows and plots and dreams. They call themselves the
People, but the people of the surface world call them the Lords
Subterranean, the Ghoul Imperium, or simply the Empire of
the Ghouls. Their cities lie out of sight, their agents infiltrate the
underworlds of a score of surface cities, and their goals know no
limits. To them, if you are not a member of the People, you are food.*

**Master of Disguise.** A darakhul in a prepared disguise has
advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to pass as
a living creature. While using this ability, the darakhul loses
its stench.

**Stench.** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the
darakhul must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving
throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. A
successful saving throw makes the creature immune to the
darakhul’s stench for 24 hours. A darakhul using this ability
can’t also benefit from Master of Disguise.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** The darakhul has disadvantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on sight and on attack rolls while
it, the object it is trying to see or attack in direct sunlight.

**Turning Defiance.** The darakhul and any ghouls within 30 feet
of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn
undead.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The darakhul bites once, claws once, and makes
one war pick attack. Using a shield limits the darakhul to
making either its claw or war pick attack, but not both.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target creature
is humanoid it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving
throw or contract darakhul fever.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature
other than an undead, it must make a successful DC 12
Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A
paralyzed target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a humanoid
creature is paralyzed for 2 or more rounds (the victim fails at
least 2 saving throws), consecutive or nonconsecutive, the
creature contracts darakhul fever.

**War Pick.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.
