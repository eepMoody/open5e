Beggar Ghoul
------------

*This emaciated, gray husk of a creature wears rags and picks
hungrily at a sliver of bone. It moves in a crouch so low that it’s
almost crawling, but its eyes glow like flickering coals and it exudes
a desperate ferocity with each raspy, rot-fouled breath.*

**Lesser Ghouls.** Most ghouls are not
darakhul but lesser strains of ghouls and ghasts. Beggar
ghouls are by far the weakest of these.

**Withered and Deprived.** Thin
and emaciated even for undead,
beggar ghouls are shriveled versions
of their standard cousins—little more than
flesh-covered skeletons. While some beggar
ghouls spend their entire existence in undeath as
this weak strain, at least a few were once stronger ghouls who
withered when they were trapped far from sources of flesh.
