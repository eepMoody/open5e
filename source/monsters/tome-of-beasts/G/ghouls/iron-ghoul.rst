Iron Ghoul
----------

*A brutal and vicious-looking ghoul that carries a cruel glaive, its
forearms up to its elbows are stained with dark, dried blood. Its
glowing, rust-colored eyes penetrate with a calculating stare of
restrained hunger.*

**Fond of Uniforms.** Iron ghouls are proud of their status and
uniforms. Their standard breastplates and open-faced helms
are black iron with brass trim, and the helm’s crest is often a
ruby‑dyed fan of bat wings or carrion beetle bristles to indicate
their authority.

**Tooth and Bone Weaponry.** Many items of an iron ghoul’s
gear are decorated with inlaid bone or set with teeth, rather
much as pearls might be used for
weapons crafted elsewhere.
