Gnoll, Havoc Runner
-------------------

The runner is a mottled blur, a sprinting gnoll laughing as it runs,
ax held high. It sprints past, its weapon flashing in the sun.

With the bristly mane and spotted fur characteristic of all
gnolls, havoc runners blend into their tribe. Only the canny glint
in the eyes hints at the deadly difference before the havoc runner
explodes into violence.

**Blinding Raids.** Havoc runners are scouring storms across
the trade routes that crisscross the tribe’s territory. Like all
gnolls, they are deadly in battle. Havoc runners incorporate
another quality that makes them the envy of many raiders:
they can tell at a glance which pieces of loot from a laden
camel or wagon are the most valuable, without spending time
rummaging, weighing, or evaluating. Their ability to strike
into a caravan, seize the best items, and withdraw quickly is
unparalleled.
