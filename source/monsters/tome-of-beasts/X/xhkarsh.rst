Xhkarsh
-------

*Watching with many rows of eyes, this mantis creature strikes with
slashing claws and recurved barbs dripping with venom.*

**Dimensional Travelers.** The clandestine xhkarsh are
beings from another cosmic cycle. Their devices and armor
are incomprehensible to—possibly even incompatible with—
creatures of this reality.

**Tamper with Fate.** The xhkarsh utilize their fate-altering
powers to distort personal histories and manipulate mortal
destinies like puppeteers. By doing this, they realign the universe
toward their own, esoteric ends—but what those ends might be,
only the xhkarsh know.

**Foes of Skein Witches.** Skein witches and valkyries
are perpetual enemies of the xhkarsh, whom they accuse of
perverting the proper run of destiny for both great heroes and
ordinary folk.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The xhkarsh makes two
claw attacks and two stinger attacks.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit,
reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5)
slashing damage.

**Stinger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit,
reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 12 (2d6
+ 5) piercing damage, and the target
must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving
throw or have its fate corrupted. A creature
with corrupted fate has disadvantage on
Charisma checks and Charisma saving
throws, and it is immune to divination spells and to effects
that sense emotions or read thoughts. The target’s fate can be
restored by a dispel evil and good spell or comparable magic.

**Seize Strand.** The xhkarsh targets one creature within 5 feet
of it whose fate has been corrupted. The target creature must
succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or a portion of the
xhkarsh’s consciousness inhabits its body. The target retains
control of its body, but the xhkarsh can control its actions for
1 minute each day and can modify its memories as a bonus
action (as if using the modify memory spell, DC 15). The target
is unaware of the xhkarsh’s presence, but can make a DC 18
Wisdom (Insight) check once every 24 hours to notice the
presence of the xhkarsh. This effect lasts until the xhkarsh ends
it or the target’s fate is restored by a dispel evil and good spell
or comparable magic. A creature becomes immune to this
effect for 24 hours when it succeeds on the saving throw to
resist the effect or after the effect ends on it for any reason. A
single xhkarsh can seize up to four strands at the same time.

**Invisibility.** The xhkarsh turns invisible until it attacks or casts
a spell, or until its concentration ends. Equipment the xhkarsh
wears or carries becomes invisible with it.
