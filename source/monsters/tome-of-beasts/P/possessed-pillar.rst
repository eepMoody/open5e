Possessed Pillar
----------------

*This ancient animal-headed pillar is engraved with weathered
symbols from ancient empires.*

**Animal Headed.** Possessed pillars are carved from enormous
blocks of stone to look like animal-headed gods of ancient
pantheons, or sometimes demonic figures of zealous cults. The
most common are the jackal-faced and the ibis-headed variants,
but pillars with baboon, crocodile, elephant, or hawk heads also
exist.

**Hijacked by Cults.** Some such pillars are claimed by various
cults, and carved anew with blasphemous symbols or smeared
with blood, oils, and unguents as sacrificial offerings.

**Weapon Donations.** Priests claim the weapons stolen by the
pillars and distribute them to temple guards or sell them to fund
temple activities.

**Constructed Nature.** A possessed pillar doesn’t
require air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Magic Resistance.** The pillar has advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical

**Magic Weapons.** The pillar’s weapon attacks
are magical.

**Steal Weapons.** The eldritch magic that powers the pillar
produces a magnetic power that seizes metal objects that
touch it, including metal weapons. When a creature successfully
strikes the pillar with a metal melee weapon, the attacker must
make a successful DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw or
the weapon becomes stuck to the pillar until the pillar releases
it or is destroyed. The saving throw uses the same ability as the
attack used. The pillar can release all metal weapons stuck to
it whenever it wants. A pillar always drops all weapons stuck to
it when it believes it’s no longer threatened. This ability affects
armor only during a grapple.

**False Appearance.** While the pillar remains motionless, it is
indistinguishable from a statue or a carved column.
