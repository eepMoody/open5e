Pombero
-------

*This squat little man has long limbs and skin the color of coal, and
the backs of its hands and tops of its feet are covered in thick hair.
Its face seems a bit too wide for its head, and its eyes gleam a little
too brightly in the pale light.*

Pomberos are strange tricksters, born of shadows in the
wild. At rest, they tend to adopt a squatting posture,
which accentuates their too-long limbs. They shun
bright light, though it doesn’t harm them, and seek out
shadows and half-light. For this reason, they are known
as the Night People.

**Joy of Trespassing.** Pomberos take delight from
creeping into places where they don’t belong and
stealing interesting objects. A pombero’s lair is littered
with trinkets, both commonplace and valuable. The blame
for all manner of misfortune is laid at the pombero’s hairy feet.

**Hatred of Hunters.** In contrast to their larcenous ways,
pomberos take great umbrage over the killing of animals and
the destruction of trees in their forests. Birds are particularly
beloved pets, and they enjoy mimicking bird songs and calls
most of all. Villagers in areas near pombero territory must be
careful to treat the animals and trees with respect, and killing
birds usually is a strong taboo in such areas.

**Sneak Attack (1/turn).** The pombero does an extra 7 (2d6)

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The pombero uses Charming Touch if able, and
makes two fist attacks.

**Fist.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled
(escape DC 13).

**Charming Touch (recharge 5-6).** The pombero chooses a
creature it can see within 5 feet. The creature must make a
successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 10
minutes. The effect ends if the charmed creature takes damage.
The pombero can have only one creature at a time charmed
with this ability. If it charms a new creature, the previous charm
effect ends immediately.

**Invisibility.** The pombero becomes invisible until it chooses to
end the effect as a bonus action, or when it attacks.
