Clockwork Huntsman
------------------

*A clockwork huntsman is mechanical soldier clad in flat-black
armor, and beneath its breastplate, gears tick and whir.*

**Slave Hunters.** These metal huntsmen were once the
province of corrupt aristocrats, running down escaped slaves
and tracking prey in hunting expeditions. Their masters may
vary, but the clockwork huntsmen still perform when called
upon. In some places they operate only on the command of the
secret police, hunting down persons of interest wanted
for questioning.

Huntsmen may operate alone, but usually they seek their
quarry as a small group of two or three. Because they are
unsleeping and tireless, few can hide from them for long
without magical assistance.

**Despised Machines.** Clockwork huntsmen are painted
matte black with mithral trim, and occasionally outfitted
with armor or a black steel blade for added intimidation.
Common folk detest them; all but their keepers and
commanders shun them.

**Obedient to Orders.** Bound with specific instructions,
clockwork huntsmen patrol, stand sentry, or remain
unmoving as ordered, always paying attention, always
alert to their surroundings. Clockwork huntsmen are
unrelenting and single-minded in their missions,
focusing on particular targets—priests, spellcasters,
or heavily armored intruders, as directed. Oblivious to
injury, clockwork huntsmen attack until destroyed or
ordered to stand down.

Clockwork huntsmen stand nearly six feet tall and
weigh 400 lb.

**Constructed Nature.** A clockwork huntsman
doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

A mechanism within the clockwork huntsman’s chest can
fire a net with a 20-foot trailing cable anchored within the
huntsman’s chest. A creature can free itself (or another
creature) from the net by using its action to make a successful
DC 10 Strength check or by dealing 5 slashing damage to the
net. The huntsman can fire up to four nets before it must be
reloaded.

**Explosive Core.** The mechanism that powers the huntsman
explodes when the construct is destroyed, projecting
superheated steam and shrapnel. Every creature within 5 ft. of
the construct takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, or half damage with
a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.
