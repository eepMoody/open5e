Clockwork Myrmidon
------------------

*This hulking brass and iron creature resembles a
giant suit of plate armor; a constant growl issues
from its midsection. It stands 9 feet tall and its
squat head wears an angry expression.
A clockwork myrmidon always moves with
moves with a powerful, determined grace
unusual in most clockwork creations.*

**Elite Machines.** Clockwork myrmidons
are heavily armored at their joints and at
most vital parts. They are much too valuable
to undertake patrols or menial labor, and they
are unleashed only for dangerous situations that
clockwork watchmen cannot handle.

**Single Targets.** A clockwork myrmidon defends
itself but does not initiate combat unless so directed by its
master. When it does enter battle, a clockwork myrmidon
is unrelenting and single-minded, and it attacks one particular
target until that foe surrenders, escapes, or is defeated.

Unless given other instructions, a clockwork myrmidon
attacks whatever enemy is closest to it. A clockwork myrmidon
attacks until destroyed or ordered to stand down.

**Alchemical Tricks.** A clockwork myrmidon is always
outfitted with alchemical fire, acids, grease, and other special
devices. An alchemist is required to keep one running well.

**Constructed Nature.** A clockwork myrmidon doesn’t
require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The clockwork myrmidon makes two attacks: two
pick attacks or two slam attacks, or one of each.

**Heavy Pick.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target.
*Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (1d12 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

**Alchemical Flame Jet (Recharge 5-6).** The clockwork
myrmidon can spew a jet of alchemical fire in a line 20 feet
long and 5 feet wide. Any creature in the path of the jet takes
26 (4d12) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15
Dexterity saving throw. The clockwork myrmidon can use this
attack four times before its internal reservoir is emptied.

**Grease Spray (Recharge 5-6).** As a bonus action, the clockwork
myrmidon’s chest can fire a spray of alchemical grease with
a range of 30 feet, covering a 10-by-10 foot square area and
turning it into difficult terrain. Each creature standing in the
affected area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw
or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn
there must also succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or
fall prone. The clockwork myrmidon can use this attack four
times before its internal reservoir is emptied.

**Alchemical Fireball.** The clockwork myrmidon’s alchemical
flame reservoir explodes when the construct is destroyed,
spraying nearby creatures with burning fuel. A creature within
5 feet of the myrmidon takes 19 (3d12) fire damage, or half
damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. This
explosion doesn’t occur if the clockwork myrmidon has already
fired its alchemical flame jet four times.
