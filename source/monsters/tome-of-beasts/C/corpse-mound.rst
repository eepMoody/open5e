Corpse Mound
------------

*The reeking pile of bodies and bones as large as a giant lurches
forward. Corpses that tumble off it rise moments later as undead
and follow the determined hill of corruption.*

**Rise from Mass Graves.** In times of plague and war,
hundreds of bodies are dumped into mass graves. Without
sanctifying rites, necromantic magic can seep into the mound
of bodies and animate them as a massive horror hungering for
others to join its form.

**Absorb Bodies.** A corpse mound is driven to kill by the anger
and loneliness of the dead within, and to absorb the bodies of its
victims. It attacks any living creature larger than a dog, but it is
drawn to humans and humanoids. It never tires no matter how
many victims it accumulates. Entire towns have been wiped out
by advancing corpse mounds.

**Undead Nature.** A corpse mound doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

**Noxious Aura.** Creatures that are within 20
feet of the corpse mound at the end of its

saving throw or become poisoned until the
end of their next turn. On a successful saving
throw, the creature is immune to the Noxious
Aura for 24 hours.

**Zombie Drop.** At the start of the corpse
mound’s turn during combat, one corpse
falls from the mound onto the ground and
immediately rises as a zombie under its control.
Up to 10 such zombies can be active at one time.
Zombies take their turns immediately after
the corpse mound’s turn.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The corpse mound makes two weapon attacks or
uses envelop once.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 18 (2d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic
damage and the target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 17). Until this
grapple ends, the target is :ref:`srd:restrained`.

**Bone Shard.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, range 30/120
ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d6 + 7) piercing damage and 10 (3d6)
necrotic damage. When hit, the target must make a successful
DC 17 Strength check or be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`, pinned to the
ground by the shard, and :ref:`srd:restrained`. To end this restraint, the
target or a creature adjacent to it must use an action to make a
successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check to remove the shard.

**Envelop.** The corpse mound makes a slam attack against a
restrained creature. If the attack hits, the target takes damage
as normal, is pulled 5 feet into the corpse mound’s space, and
is enveloped, which ends any grappled or prone condition.
While enveloped, the creature is :ref:`srd:blinded` and :ref:`srd:restrained`, it has
total cover against attacks and other effects outside the corpse
mound, and it takes 21 (6d6) necrotic damage at the start of
each of the corpse mound’s turns. An enveloped creature can
escape by using its action to make a successful DC 17 Strength
saving throw. If the corpse mound takes 30 or more damage
on a single turn from the enveloped creature, it must succeed
on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or
expel the creature, which falls :ref:`srd:prone` in a space within 10 feet
of the corpse mound. If the corpse mound dies, an enveloped
creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape by using
10 feet of movement, exiting :ref:`srd:prone`. A corpse mound can
envelop up to 4 creatures at once.
