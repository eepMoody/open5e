Carrion Beetle
--------------

*The beetles wore golden bridles and carried huge leather sacks of
stone and guano. They marched without stopping; dozens, even
hundreds, bringing fresh earth to the white-fungus trees of the
great forests. Their claws skittered with a sound like horseshoes
slipping on stone, but their multiple legs ensured they never
fell. The air around them singed the nostrils with the taint
of acid.*

**Beasts of Burden and War.** Carrion beetles
are powerful beasts of burden with strong jaws
and the ability to both climb and burrow.
With a wide back, serrated, spiky forelegs,
and a narrow head, the carrion beetle is too
large to ride on very comfortably although
it makes an excellent platform for ballistae
and howdahs. Its thick exoskeleton varies
from drab brown, tan, and black to shimmering
blue green, purple-green, and a highly prized
yellow‑orange.

The largest carrion beetles make a distinctive
wheezing sound when their spiracles are stressed;
this noise creates a hum when multiple beetles
run or charge on the field of battle. War
beetles are often armored with protective
strips of metal or chitinous armor fused to
their exoskeletons, increasing their natural
armor by +2 while reducing their speed to 20
feet.

**Devour Fungi and Carrion.** Carrion
beetles rarely gather in groups larger than a
breeding pair and a small cluster of offspring in
the wild. The domesticated varieties travel in herds of 20-40
to feed on fungal forests, scavenge battlefields, or devour cave
lichen and scour sewage pits. The larger caravan beetles are
always antagonistic.

When breeding season hits, carrion beetles feast on the bodies
of large animals. They are often found in symbiotic relationships
with :ref:`deathcap mycolids <tob:deathcap-myconid>`, :ref:`tob:darakhul-ghoul`, and related species. Many
species in the deep underworld consider carrion beetles food
and use their exoskeletons to fashion shields and armor (though
their chitin is too brittle for weaponry).

:ref:`Purple worms <srd:purple-worm>` are their major predators. Worms swallow
entire caravans when they find the beetles within.

**Domesticated by Ghouls.** Domesticated by the darakhul,
the carrion beetles live a more complex life. They begin as simple
pack animals, with the strongest being trained as war beetles.
War beetles often carry ballistae and harpoons fitted with lines
for use against flying foes.

In late life, the beetles are used as excavators, scouring out
tunnels with their acid. After death, their exoskeletons are used
both as animated scouting vehicles (ghouls hide within the shell
to approach hostile territory) and as armored undead platforms
packed with archers and spellcasters.
