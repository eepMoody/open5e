Cavelight Moss
--------------

*These patches of tangled, lacy moss cling to the ceiling, slowly
pulsing with an eerie glow. Their stems gently writhe among the
soft, feathery mass, dusting the ground below with a twinkling of
phosphorescent spores.*

**Plant Carnivore.** Cavelight moss glows with a pale yellow
light, but when agitated, its light changes to an icy blue.
Cavelight moss is frequently mistaken for a benign organism,
but it hunts living flesh and renders its meals immobile before
starting the long process of digestion.

A cavelight moss is a collective of smaller life forms patched
together and sharing sensations. Barely cognitive, a cavelight
moss spends its time positioning itself above well-traveled
sections of cavern, feeding on rats, bats, and crawling insects.
When it senses larger prey, it slowly and quietly moves toward
the creature.

**Long-Lived Spores.** A cavelight moss can survive for 200
years, shedding luminous spores and consuming vermin. Its
spores germinate in the carcasses of its victims, and in lean
times, these spores can grow, albeit slowly, on guano or other
areas rich in moisture and organic nutrients.

**Rare Colonies.** If a cave system has no true protectors and
food is plentiful, these creatures congregate—most commonly,
in bat colonies of millions of individuals. When they gather
this way, cavelight mosses function as a large colony, covering
strategic locations where prey roams. When a source of food
moves on, the entire colony slowly disperses as well.

**Luminescence.** The chemicals within cavelight moss make

cannot suppress this effect. It can, however, diminish the light
produced to shed illumination as a candle.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Tendrils.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 33 (4d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target
is a creature, it is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 17). Until this grapple
ends, the target is :ref:`srd:restrained`, and the cavelight moss can’t use
its tendrils against another target.

**Strength Drain.** Living creatures hit by the cavelight moss’s
tendril attack or caught up in its grapple must make a
successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or 1 level of
:ref:`srd:exhaustion`. Creatures that succeed are immune to that
particular cavelight moss’s Strength Drain ability for 24 hours.
For every level of exhaustion drained, the cavelight moss gains
5 temporary hit points.
