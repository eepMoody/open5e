Clockwork Weaving Spider
------------------------

*This clockwork creature looks like a mechanical spider with long,
spindly legs, including one equipped with a particularly sharp
blade that’s disproportionately large for the creature’s body.*

**Cloth Makers.** These tiny but useful devices are a boon to
weavers as they help produce clothing—and they also sometimes
serve as spies and defenders, for nothing is so invisible as a
simple machine making cloth, day in and day out. As their name
implies, these devices resemble large spiders but with ten limbs
instead of eight. Two of their legs are equipped with loops or
crooks useful in guiding thread on a loom, six are for moving
and climbing, one is for stitching and extremely fast
needlework, and one has a razor-sharp blade used to trim
thread or cloth (or for attacking foes).

**Throw Poison.** Weaving spiders rarely initiate combat
unless directed to by their owners, but they instinctively
defend themselves, their masters, and other weavers. A
weaving spider throws its poisoned shuttle at the nearest
foe, then climbs along the strand to attack that foe. Weaving
spiders fight until destroyed or ordered to stand down.
When spying, they flee as soon as they are threatened, to
preserve whatever information they have gathered.

**Constructed Nature.** A clockwork weaving spider
doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The weaving spider makes two trimming blade
attacks or two needle shuttle attacks.

**Trimming Blade.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage and possible
unmaking.

**Poisoned Needle Shuttle.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit,
range 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage,
and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving
throw or become paralyzed. The target repeats the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself with a success.

**Unmaking.** The weaving spider’s speed and its slim, sharp
blade can slice cloth, leather, and paper into scraps very
quickly. Whenever a weaving spider’s trimming blade attack
roll exceeds the target’s armor class by 5 or more, the target
must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or one
of their possessions becomes unusable or damaged until
repaired (DM’s choice)
