Chronalmental
-------------

*A chronalmental is difficult to pin down, and it may appear as
a large man-shaped absence in the air that reveals first a field of
stars, then a contorted rainbow of colored bands, then a brilliant
white light, strobing in and out of existence.*

**Fluid as Time.** Shifting between the past, present, and future,
chronalmentals are formed from temporal energy. They flow like
sand in an hourglass and exist between the tickings of a clock.

The first chronalmentals were forged from extra time left
over from the beginning of the universe. Many served as shock
troopers in unfathomable wars between angels and fiends or
gods and ancient titans. Most were lost between seconds or
abandoned to drift aimlessly in the Astral Plane or in the void
between the stars.

**Stewards of Calamity.** Locations of historical significance—
both past and future—attract chronalmentals. They have a
fondness for battlefields and other sites of strife. Because
they are drawn to noteworthy places, chronalmentals have a
reputation as harbingers of calamity, and their presence may
incite panic among scholars, priests, and sages.

**Environmental Chaos.** Whatever the terrain, the
environment behaves strangely around the chronalmental.
Collapsed walls might suddenly rise, seedlings become massive
trees, and fallen soldiers relive their dying moments. These
changes occur randomly, a side-effect of a chronalmental’s
presence, and things return to normal when they depart.

**Elemental Nature.** A chronalmental does not require air,
food, drink, or sleep.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The chronalmental makes 1d4 + 1 slam attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

**Steal Time (1/Day).** The chronalmental targets one creature it
can see within 30 feet of it. The targeted creature must make
a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the
chronalmental draws some of the creature’s time into itself
and gains +10 to its position in initiative order. In addition, the
target’s speed is reduced by half, it can’t take reactions, and
it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but
not both. While it is stealing time, the chronalmental’s speed
increases by 30 feet, and when it takes the multiattack action, it
can make an additional slam attack. The targeted creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
the effect on a success.

**Displace (Recharge 5-6).** The chronalmental targets one
creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed
on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be magically shunted
outside of time. The creature disappears for 1 minute. As an
action, the displaced creature can repeat the saving throw. On
a success, the target returns to its previously occupied space,
or the nearest unoccupied space.

Reaction
~~~~~~~~

**Step Between Seconds (Recharge 4-6).** When a creature
the chronalmental can see moves within 5 feet of it, the
chronalmental can shift itself to a place it occupied in the past,
teleporting up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space, along with
any equipment it is wearing or carrying.
