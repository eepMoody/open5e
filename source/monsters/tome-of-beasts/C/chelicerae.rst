Chelicerae
----------

*A chelicerae resembles a massive spider perched on tall, stilted legs.
Most often, the disheveled body of a robed arcanist swings from its
clenched mandibles.*

**Feed on Spellcasters.** These massive arachnids are largely
confined to the great forests and occasional wastelands, although
rumors do persist of sightings in the dark alleys of magocratic
cities, causing trepidation among the spellcasters there. Few
creatures pose such a threat to spellcasters as chelicerae.

**Carry Their Prey.** Walking on high, stilted legs, these
creatures resemble gigantic harvesters. More often than not,
they are found with the grisly bodies of humanoids dangling
from the chelicerae’s clenched mandibles.

**Cocoon Arcanists.** Chelicerae stalk isolated victims, striking
them with a poisonous bite and then pinning its prey within
its jaws. There, their helpless body can hang for days on end
as the chelicerae pursues obscure and eldritch tasks. At best,
victims wake up weeks later with no memory of the events, far
from home, and drained of vitality and spells. Others are stored
immobilized in a thick cocoon in a high treetop until their body
and mind recover. A few unlucky victims are slain and animated
as walking dead to protect the chelicerae.

**Magic Resistance.** The chelicerae has advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spellcasting.** The chelicerae is an 8th-level
spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence
(spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks).
It requires no material components to cast its
spells. The chelicerae has the following wizard
spells prepared:

**Cantrips:** acid splash, mage hand, minor illusion,
true strike

**1st level:** burning hands, detect magic, expeditious
retreat, ray of sickness

**2nd level:** hold person, invisibility, scorching ray

**3rd level:** animate dead, haste, lightning bolt

**4th level:** phantasmal killer

**Siphon Spell Slots.** The chelicerae cannot replenish its spells
naturally. Instead, it uses grappled spellcasters as spell
reservoirs, draining uncast spells to power its own casting.
Whenever the chelicerae wishes to cast a spell, it consumes
a number of spell slots from its victim equal to the spell slots
necessary to cast the spell. If the victim has too few spell slots
available, the chelicerae cannot cast that spell.

The chelicerae can also draw power from drained
spellcasters or creatures without magic ability. It can reduce a
grappled creature’s Wisdom by 1d4, adding 2 spell slots to its
spell reservoir for every point lowered. A creature reduced to 0
Wisdom is unconscious until it regains at least one point, and
can’t offer any more power. A creature regains all lost Wisdom
when it finishes a long rest.

**Spider Climb.** Chelicerae can climb difficult surfaces, including
upside down on ceilings, without requiring an ability check.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The chelicerae makes one bite attack and two claw
attacks.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage, and the target is grappled
(escape DC 16). The target must also make a successful DC
16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While
poisoned this way, the target is unconscious and takes
1d4 Strength damage at the start of each of its turns. The
poisoning ends after 4 rounds or when the target makes a
successful DC 16 Constitution save at the end of its turn.
