Ice Maiden
----------

*This alluring beauty has flesh and hair as white as snow and eyes
blue as glacial ice.*

**Born of the Ice.** Ice maidens are the daughters of powerful
creatures of the cold. Some are descendants of Boreas or the
Snow Queen (a few having both parents), but they are also
born to frost giants and thursir. A few result from tearful pleas
by pregnant women lost in the snows, desperate to keep their
newborn child from freezing to death—the fraughashar carry
these infants away and raise them as ice maidens.

**Solitary Lives.** Most ice maidens live solitary existences save
for a servant or two under their thrall. They’re lonely creatures,
desperate for love but condemned to know companionship
only through their magical kiss. If genuine love ever fills an ice
maiden’s heart, she’ll melt into nothingness.

**Killing Dilemma.** An ice maiden’s hunger for affection and
human contact leads them to harm those they approach, which
only drives them harder to seek for warmth, love, and approval.
Some claim an ice maiden can become a swan maiden or a dryad
if she keeps a lover’s heart warm for a full year.

**Chilling Presence.** Cold air surrounds the ice maiden. Small
non-magical flames are extinguished in her presence and
water begins to freeze. Unprotected characters spending
more than 10 minutes within 15 feet of her must succeed on
a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer as if exposed to
severe cold. Spells that grant protection from cold damage are
targeted by an automatic dispel magic effect.

**Cold Eyes.** Ice maidens see perfectly in snowy conditions,
including driving blizzards, and are immune to snow blindness.

**Ice Walk.** Ice maidens move across icy and snowy surfaces
without penalty.

**Snow Invisibility.** In snowy environments, the ice maiden can
turn :ref:`srd:invisible` as a bonus action.

**Magic Resistance.** The ice maiden has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Innate Spellcasting.**
The ice maiden’s innate
spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC
17). She can innately cast
the following spells:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:chill-touch`, :ref:`srd:detect-magic`, :ref:`srd:light`, :ref:`srd:mage-hand`,
:ref:`srd:prestidigitation`, :ref:`srd:resistance`

**5/day each:** *endure-elements*
(cold only), :ref:`srd:fear`, :ref:`srd:fog-cloud`,
:ref:`srd:misty-step`

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:alter-self`, :ref:`srd:protection-from-energy`, :ref:`srd:sleet-storm`

**1/day:** :ref:`srd:ice-storm`

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The frost maiden makes
two ice dagger attacks.

**Ice Dagger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6
to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage
plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.

**Flurry-Form.** The ice maiden adopts the form of a swirling
snow cloud. Her stats are identical to an air elemental that
deals cold damage instead of bludgeoning.

**Icy Entangle.** Ice and snow hinder her opponent’s movement,
as the :ref:`srd:entangle` spell (DC 17).

**Kiss of the Frozen Heart.** An ice maiden may kiss a willing
individual, freezing the target’s heart. The target falls under the
sway of a :ref:`srd:dominate-person` spell, his or her alignment shifts to LE, and
he or she gains immunity to cold. The ice maiden can have
up to three such servants at once. The effect can be broken
by :ref:`srd:dispel-magic` (DC 17), :ref:`srd:greater-restoration`, or the kiss of
someone who loves the target.

**Snowblind Burst.** In a snowy environment, the ice maiden
attempts to blind all creatures within 30 feet of herself. Those
who fail a DC 17 Charisma saving throw are :ref:`srd:blinded` for 1 hour.
Targets that are immune to cold damage are also immune to
this effect.
