Imy-ut Ushabti
--------------

*These tomb guardians walk their rounds silently, an ornate sword
in its hand. Glittering scarabs scurry from under their deformed
and yellowed linen wrappings.*

**Willing Sacrifices.** The undying servants of the god‑kings
and queens of ancient times, the imy-ut ushabti guard the tombs
of their masters and shepherd them toward their eventual
awakening. Generals, trusted advisors, and close allies of their
god-king willingly accompanied their dying lords into the
afterlife through a horrifying transformation. Still alive, they are
tightly bound in linens and sealed within a sarcophagus among
a swarm of flesh‑eating scarabs that, over a period of days to
weeks, fully consumed their bodies. The servant’s devotion to
their task and the anguish of their passing transforms the scarab
colony and animates the funerary wrappings to carry on the
imy-ut’s duty.

**Scarab Mummies.** From a distance, the imy-ut ushabti are
indistinguishable from the mummified form of their master,
betrayed only by the reserved ornamentation of their lacquered
armor and the ripples of movement beneath their wrappings
from the mass of scarabs beneath it.

**Warding Triads.** Traditionally, imy‑ut ushabti
appear only in triads—the warden, charged
with ensuring the death sleep of their
god‑queen is uninterrupted; the steward,
tasked with escorting their master back
from the land of the dead; and the herald, proclaiming their
lord’s return to the world of the living.

**Regeneration.** The imy-ut ushabti regains 5 hit points at the
start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.

**Rent wrappings.** A creature that touches or deals slashing or
piercing damage to an imy-ut ushabti while within 5 feet of
the creature shreds its delicate linen wrappings, releasing a
flurry of skittering scarabs. The attacking creature must make
a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid them. On a failure,
these beetles flow onto the attacker and deal 3 (1d6) piercing
damage to it at the start of each of its turns. A creature can
remove beetles from itself or from another affected creature
within reach by using an action and making a successful DC
12 Dexterity saving throw. The beetles are also destroyed if the
affected creature takes damage from an area effect.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Ceremonial Greatsword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach
5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage, and the
target must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw
or take 5 (2d4) poison damage at the start of each of its turns.
The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Vomit Swarm (1/Day).** The imy-ut ushabti parts its wrappings
voluntarily and releases a swarm of scarab beetles that follow
its mental commands. The statistics of this swarm are identical
to a :ref:`srd:swarm-of-insects`, but with the following attack instead of a
swarm of insects’ standard bite attack:

**Bites:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 10 (4d4) piercing damage, or 5 (2d4) piercing damage if
the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer, and the target
must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or
take 5 (2d4) poison damage at the start of each of its turns.
A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
