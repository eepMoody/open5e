*The isonade’s gargantuan thrashing tail is lined with cruelly
hooked barbs, and it delights in destruction. When it approaches
a coastal village, its tail shoots high into the air from beneath the
waves, and it smashes all ships, docks, and nets in its path.*

**Coastal Destroyer.** The isonade is a beast of destruction,
sweeping away entire islands and villages. It wrecks seaside
communities with battering winds and carves coastlines with
its powerful magic. Though not very intelligent, it singles out
a community and tries to lure residents into the waves with its
animal messenger ability, sending gulls bearing confused riddles,
grand promises, and eerie noises to the townsfolk.

**Ocean Sacrifices.** When coastal villagers suffered from a
hurricane or tsunami, they fell back on folklore and blamed the
stirrings of the dreaded isonade. To some, appeasing a leviathan
such as this makes sense. Some say that a degenerate group seeks
to draw the beast forth by sailing from sight of land and dumping
a long chain of bound and screaming sacrifices into the lightless
depths of the sea.

**Enormous Age and Size.** The isonade is more than 45 feet
long. The beast’s age is unknown, and many coastal bards tell
some version of the legend—some believe it is the last of its kind,
others believe that a small group of isonade remains.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The isonade makes one tail slap attack and one
bite attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 42 (5d12+ 10) piercing damage and the target is grappled
(escape DC 20). If the target was already grappled from a
previous bite, it’s also swallowed whole (see below).

**Tail Slap.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 31 (6d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage.

**Breach.** The isonade leaps out of the water to crash down onto
a target with devastating effect. The isonade must move 30
feet in a straight line toward its target before jumping. When
jumping, the isonade travels up to 30 feet through the air
before landing. Any creature occupying the space where the
isonade lands takes 76 (12d10 + 10) bludgeoning damage and
becomes submerged 10 feet below the surface of the water.
Targets that make a successful DC 20 Strength saving throw
take half damage and are not submerged, but are moved to
the nearest unoccupied space. Boats and structures are not
immune to this attack.

**Swallow Whole.** When the isonade’s bite attack hits a target
grappled from a previous bite attack, the target is also
swallowed. The grapple ends, but the target is blinded and
restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects
outside the isonade, and it takes 36 (8d8) acid damage at
the start of each of the isonade’s turns. An isonade can have
two Large, four Medium, or six Small creatures swallowed
at a time. If the isonade takes 40 damage or more from a
swallowed creature in a single turn, it must succeed on a DC
20 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate all swallowed
creatures, which fall prone within 10 feet of the isonade. If the
isonade dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it
and can escape by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.
