Firebird
--------

*This proud bird struts like a peacock, made all the
more majestic by its flaming fan of feathers, which
shift through the color spectrum.*

**Guides and Helpers.** Firebirds are welcome
sights to those in need of warmth and safety. They
primarily work at night or in underground areas, where
their abilities are most needed. Friendly to all creatures, they
become aggressive only upon witnessing obviously evil acts.

Firebirds enjoy working with good
adventuring parties, providing light
and healing, though their wanderlust
prevents them from staying for
long. Well-traveled parties may
encounter the same firebird
more than once, however.

**Redeemers.** Firebirds
enjoy acting as reformers.
They find mercenary creatures
they perceive as potential
“light bringers” to whom they
grant boons in exchange for
a geas to perform a specific
good deed, in the hope such
acts will redeem them.

**Magical Feathers.** Firebird feathers are prized throughout
the mortal world; occasionally, the creatures bestow feathers
upon those they favor. Firebirds also seed hidden locations with
specialized feathers, which burst into full-grown firebirds after
a year. As the creatures age, their feathers’ light dims, but this
occurs gradually, as the creatures live over 100 years. Firebirds
stand three feet tall and weigh 20 lb.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The firebird’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:geas`, :ref:`srd:heal`, :ref:`srd:reincarnate`

**Light of the World.** The firebird’s feathers glow with a warm
light. The creature sheds light as dim as a candle or as bright
as a lantern. It always sheds light, and any feathers plucked
from the creature continue to shed light as a torch.

**Warming Presence.** The firebird and any creatures within
a 5-foot radius are immune to the effects of natural,
environmental cold. Invited into a home or building, a firebird
can expand this warming presence to its inhabitants no matter
how close they are to the creature.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The firebird makes one bite attack and two claw
attacks.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
5 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 10 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

**Blinding Ray (Recharge 5-6).** The firebird can fire a burning
ray of light from its tail feathers in a line 5 feet wide and up
to 50 feet long. Targets in the line must succeed on a DC
15 Dexterity saving throw or take 24 (7d6) fire damage and
become :ref:`srd:blinded` for 1d4 rounds. A successful saving throw
negates the blindness and reduces the damage by half.
