Fellforged
----------

*A darkly foreboding intelligence glows behind this automaton’s
eyes, and its joints seep hissing green vapors.*

**Wraith Constructs.** Fellforged are the castoffs of gearforged
and clockworks production, given foul sentience when the
construct bodies attract wraiths yearning to feel the corporeal
world. The clockwork bodies trap the wraiths, which dulls many
of their supernatural abilities but gives them physical form. The
wraiths twist the bodies to their own use—going so far as to
destroy the body to harm the living.

**Soldiers for Vampires.** Fellforged commonly seek out
greater undead as their masters. Vampires and liches are
favorite leaders, but banshees and darakhul also make suitable
commanders.

**Grave Speech.** The voice of the fellforged is echoing and
sepulchral, a tomb voice that frightens animals and children.

**Constructed Nature.** A fellforged doesn’t require air,
food, drink, or sleep.

**Expelled Spirit.** While the fellforged body was made to bind
spirits, the wraith within is vulnerable to turning attempts. Any
successful turn attempt exorcises the wraith from its clockwork
frame. The expelled wraith retains its current hp total and
fights normally. The construct dies without an animating spirit.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the fellforged has
disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on sight.

**Unnatural Aura.** All animals, whether wild or domesticated, can
sense the unnatural presence of fellforged at a distance of 30
feet. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic
if forced to do so, and they remain panicked as long as they
are within that range.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The fellforged makes two necrotic slam attacks.

**Necrotic Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 11 (2d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8)
necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14
Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced
by an amount equal to the total damage taken. This reduction
lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this
effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**Violent Escapement.** With little regard for the clockwork bodies
they inhabit, fellforged wraiths can stress and strain their
mechanisms in such a violent manner that flywheels become
unbalanced, gears shatter, and springs snap. As a bonus action,
this violent burst of gears and pulleys deals 7 (2d6) piercing
damage to all foes within 5 feet who fail a DC 14 Dexterity
saving throw. Each use of this ability imposes a cumulative
reduction in movement of 5 feet upon the fellforged. If its
speed is reduced to 0 feet, the fellforged becomes :ref:`srd:paralyzed`.
