Folk of Leng
------------

*The people of Leng are hideous and malevolent, with goatlike
legs and small horns they keep concealed beneath turbans, and
mouths full of rows of serrated teeth, somewhat akin to sharks.
They have a fondness for combining heavy leathers and bright silks
in their robes, and they always go forth masked when leaving their
mysterious, chilled cities.*

**Dimensional Merchants.** The folk of Leng are interplanar
merchants and avid slavers, trading silks, rubies, and the
mana-encrusted stones of Leng for humanoid slaves. They sail between
worlds in peculiar ships with split, lateen-rigged masts and
rigging that howls like the damned in high winds. They tend a
few pyramids in the deep deserts and are said to befriend void
dragons, heralds of darkness, and other servants of the void.

**A High Plateau.** Leng is a forbidding plateau surrounded
by hills and peaks. Its greatest city is Sarkomand, a place which
some claim has fallen into ruin, and which others claim
to have visited in living memory.

**Love of Nets.** When in combat, the folk of Leng
use nets woven from the silk of their racial enemies,
the spiders of Leng. They summon these nets from
interdimensional storage spaces.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The folk of Leng’s innate spellcasting
ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:comprehend-languages`, :ref:`srd:minor-illusion`

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:disguise-self`, :ref:`srd:suggestion`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:dream`, :ref:`srd:etherealness`

**Regeneration.** The folk of Leng regains 5 hit points at the start
of its turn. If the folk of Leng takes fire or radiant damage, this
trait does not function at the start of its next turn. The folk of
Leng dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and does not
regenerate. Even if slain, their bodies reform in a crypt of Leng
and go on about their business.

**Void Stare.** The folk of Leng can see through doors and around
corners as a bonus action. As a result, they are very rarely
surprised.

**Void Sailors.** The folk of Leng can travel the airless void
without harm.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Etheric Harpoon.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, range 30
ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d8 + 6) necrotic damage, and the
target must make a successful DC 13 Wisdom saving throw
or be :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 13). In addition, armor has no
effect against the attack roll of an etheric harpoon; only the
Dexterity modifier factored into the target’s AC is considered.

**Psychic Scimitar.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6)
psychic damage.

**Hooked Spider Net (Recharge 5-6).** *Ranged Weapon Attack.*
+4 to hit, range 20/50 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (1d6) piercing
damage plus 19 (3d12) poison damage, and the target is
:ref:`srd:restrained`. A successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw
halves the poison damage.
