Frostveil
---------

*“They took the sled dogs first, and later the seal-skinner set to guard them.
We’d hear a confused, muffled cry in the wind and then we’d find them—a
raven harvest, cold and stiff on the ice. Next time, we hid ourselves and
watched, and saw them floating through the air like kites. A wisp of
blowing snow that never dispersed, a billowing, snowflake sail moving
with sinister purpose. The ‘cloak of death’ our skraeling guide called it.”*

Whipped through the air by snowstorms and resembling a
spider’s web dangling with delicate ice crystals, these silently
gliding, beautiful killers are semi-sentient plants adapted to the
merciless cold of the North.

**Cloak of Death.** Flat nodes shaped like large snowflakes
connect their net-like bodies and trailing tails of transparent
fibers. Gossamer tendrils stream behind and between the flying
snowflakes, ready to grab and entangle any warm-blooded
creature it detects.

**Seek Warmth.** Each star-like node contains crude sensory
organs, able to detect warmth as meager as a living creature’s
breath and steer the gliding web toward it.

**Spirit Spores.** Northern shamans say the dance of the
frostveils is beautiful when lit by the northern lights, and a
powerful omen. With great care, shamans sometimes harvest
frostveils for their frozen spore-shards, which grant potent
visions of the spirit world when melted on the tongue.

**Chilling Acid.** The frostveil’s
frozen acidic mist breaks
down flesh and organic
materials into useable nutrients. Creatures who strike the
frostveil with a non-reach melee weapon or an unarmed strike
take 4 (1d8) acid damage.

**False Appearance.** While the frostveil remains motionless, it is
indistinguishable from a formation of frost and ice.

**Windborne.** While in blowing wind, the frostveil can fly with a
speed of 30 feet. In a strong wind this speed increases to 60
feet.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The frostveil makes three tendril attacks.

**Tendril.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If two tendrils hit the
same target in a single turn, the target is engulfed.

**Engulf.** When a frostveil wraps itself around a Medium or
smaller creature, the target takes 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning
damage plus 13 (3d8) acid damage and is grappled (escape
DC 15). The target takes another 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage
plus 13 (3d8) acid damage at the end of each of its turns when
it’s still grappled by the frostveil. A frostveil can’t attack while
it has a creature engulfed. Damage from attacks against the
frostveil is split evenly between the frostveil and the engulfed
creature; the only exceptions are slashing and psychic damage,
which affect only the frostveil.

**Spirit Spores (recharge 6).** In distress, frostveils release a puff
of psychotropic spores in a 10-foot cloud around themselves.
Creatures within the cloud of spores must succeed on a
DC 13 Constitution saving throw against poison or suffer
hallucinations, as per a confusion spell, for 1d3 rounds.
