Feyward Tree
------------

*Dark, bark-like rust encrusts the trunk of this cold-forged metal
tree, and its dull metallic leaves rustle with the sound of sharp metal.*

**Cold Iron Trees.** These ferrous constructs are cold-forged in
a process taking several years, as bits of rust and other oxidation
are cultivated one layer at a time into bark and branches. In this
way, the artificers create massive, twisted trunks resembling real,
gnarled trees. Green-tinged leaves of beaten cold iron are welded
in place by the master craftsmen, and trained warmages bring
the construct to life through intense magical rituals rumored to
take a full turn of seasons.

**Fey Destroyers.** The tree unswervingly obeys the commands
of its creators, guarding key points of entry across fey rivers and
streams, abandoned sacred groves deep in the forest, suspected
faerie rings, or possible elf encampments. Many are released
deep in the deep elvish woods with orders to attack any fey on
sight. These feyward trees are rarely, if ever, heard from again
and whether they leave a bloody trail of flayed elves in their wake
after rampages lasting for decades or some fey counter-measure
neutralizes them is unknown.

**Growing Numbers.** Each year, the feywardens order their
construction and release, trusting in the destructive nature of
the constructs. A half-dozen might guard a single ring of toppled
elven standing stones. The feywardens leave nothing to chance.

**Constructed Nature.** A feyward tree doesn’t require air,
food, drink, or sleep.

**Magic Resistance.** A feyward tree has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Contractibility and Conductivity.** Certain spells and effects
function differently against feyward trees:

* A magical attack that deals cold damage slows a feyward
  tree (as the :ref:`srd:slow` spell) for 3 rounds.
* A magical attack that deals lightning damage breaks any
  slow effect on the feyward tree and heals 1 hit point for each
  3 damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of
  healing would cause the tree to exceed its full normal hp, it
  gains any excess as temporary hp. The tree gets no saving
  throw against lightning effects.

**Immutable Form.** The feyward tree is immune to any spell or
effect that would alter its form.

**Magic Weapons.** The feyward tree’s weapon attacks are magical.

**Warden’s Reach.** Creatures within 15 feet of a feyward tree
provoke opportunity attacks even if they take the Disengage
action before leaving its reach.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The tree makes two razor-leafed branch attacks,
and may use a bonus action to make a razor-leafed branch
attack against any creature standing next to it.

**Razor-Leafed Branch.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach
15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d8 + 8) slashing damage.

**Flaying Leaves (Recharge 5-6).** The tree can launch a barrage
of razor-sharp cold iron leaves from its branches in a 20-foot-radius
burst. All creatures caught within this area must make
a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 21 (6d6)
slashing damage, or half as
much damage on a
successful one.
