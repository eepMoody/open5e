Tophet
------

*An enormous bronze and iron statue
filled with fire towers above the ring of
chanting, frenzied worshipers.*

Tophets are used by worshipers of fire
gods, who toss sacrifices into their flaming
maws to incinerate them. A tophet has a
large opening in the front where the flames
can be seen; sometimes this is an enormous
mouth, and at other times it is a large hole
in the tophet’s belly. Horns and expressions
of anger or wide‑mouthed laughter are
common.

**Eager for Sacrifices.** Among fire cultists,
it’s widely known that when a tophet’s hands are raised above
its mouth, it is demanding a sacrifice to roll down its palms and
into its fiery maw.

**Heed Musical Commands.** Flutes and drums can
(sometimes) be used to control the actions of a tophet during
sacrifices. They have the fortunate side effect of drowning out
the cries and screams of living sacrifices.

**Magical Fires.** The fires within a tophet’s bronze body
are largely magical and fueled by sacrifices. They don’t
require more than a symbolic amount of wood or coal
to keep burning, but they do require sacrifices of food,
cloth, and (eventually) living creatures to keep them under
control. A tophet that is not granted a sacrifice when it
demands one might go on a fiery rampage, burning down
buildings, granaries, or barns until its hunger is satisfied.

**Constructed Nature.** A tophet doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

will. Its heat is such that all creatures have resistance to cold
damage while within 30 feet of the tophet.

**Burning Belly.** Creatures inside a tophet’s burning core take
21 (6d6) fire damage at the start of each of the tophet’s turns.
Escaping from a tophet’s belly takes 10 feet of movement and
a successful DC 16 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** A tophet makes two attacks, no more than one of
which can be a gout of flame.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack.* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 12 (1d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage. The target is also
knocked inside the tophet’s burning belly if the attack scores a
critical hit.

**Gout of Flame.** The tophet targets a point within 100 feet of
itself that it can see. All targets within 10 feet of that point take
22 (4d10) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 16
Dexterity saving throw.
