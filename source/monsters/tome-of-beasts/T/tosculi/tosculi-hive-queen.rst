Tosculi Hive-Queen
------------------

*This humanoid wasp’s gossamer wings beat out a soft, droning
buzz. Flashing blades sing in each of her four clawed hands, and
the air around her crackles with arcane energy.*

**Center of the Hive.** The hive-queen is the nerve center of a
tosculi hive-city, simultaneously one of a hive’s greatest strengths
and weaknesses. The hive-queen serves as a unifying force. She
binds her swarm with an ironclad sense of purpose through the
hive mind, the psychic web that links all tosculi within a hive.

**Deadly Inheritance.** A hive-queen typically has several
immature daughters as her potential heirs at any given time.
When she nears the end of her life, the hive-queen selects the
most promising of her heirs and feeds her a special concoction.
This speeds the heir’s maturation and makes her ready to
become a full-fledged hive-queen. The daughter’s first action
upon assuming power and control over the hive-city is to devour
her mother and all her sisters.

**Hive Chaos.** If a hive-queen dies with no heir to anchor the
hive mind, the city plunges into chaos. Tosculi bereft of the hivemind
go berserk. A few fortunate ones might escape and become
lone renegades, but their existence without the comforting
presence of the hive is miserable and short. Unless one of the
hive-queen’s daughters is mature enough and ruthless enough to
step in and assert control, the hive is doomed.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the hive-queen fails a saving
throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Hive Mind.** The hive-queen is the psychic nexus for every
tosculi in her hive. She is aware of the direction and distance
to all members of the hive, can telepathically communicate
with them when they are within 20 miles, and can sense what
they sense when they are within 1 mile of her. Tosculi from
her hive that travel more than 20 miles away instinctively
know the direction and distance to the hive and try to return.
Hive-queens sometimes dispatch rescue missions to recover
separated members of the hive.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The hive-queen makes four scimitar attacks.

**Scimitar.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.

**Stinger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature. *Hit:* 10 (1d6 + 7) piercing damage, and the target must
succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be :ref:`srd:paralyzed`
for 1 minute. A paralyzed target repeats the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Glitter Dust.** The hive-queen produces a cloud of glittering
golden particles in a 30-foot radius. Each creature that is not
a tosculi in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution
saving throw or be :ref:`srd:blinded` for 1 minute. A blinded creature
repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
the effect on itself on a success.

**Implant Egg.** The hive-queen implants an egg into an
incapacitated creature within 5 feet of her that is neither
undead nor a construct. Until the egg hatches or is removed,
the creature is :ref:`srd:poisoned`, :ref:`srd:paralyzed`, and does not need to eat
or drink. The egg hatches in 1d6 weeks, and the larval tosculi
kills the host creature. The implanted egg can be removed with
a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check or by a spell or
magical effect that cures disease.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The hive-queen can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature’s turn. The hive‑queen regains
spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Flight.** The hive-queen flies up to half its flying speed.

**Stinger Attack.** The hive-queen makes one stinger attack.

**Glitter Dust (Costs 2 Actions).** The hive-queen uses Glitter Dust.

A Tosculi Hive-Queen’s Lair
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hive-queens make their lairs in the most protected part of the
hive. Huge corridors lead to this point, so all tosculi can reach
their queen as quickly as possible. This is also the place where
tosculi eggs hatch, making it a critical location for the survival
of the hive. A tosculi hive-queen encountered in her lair has a
challenge rating of 13 (10,000 XP).

Lair Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hive-queen
takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

* The tosculi hive-queen releases a cloud of pheromones that
  drives the tosculi to fight harder. All tosculi within 60 feet of
  the hive-queen (including the hive-queen herself) regain 7
  (2d6) hit points.
* A swarm of tiny tosculi offspring crawls from its nest
  and attacks a creature within 120 feet of the hive-queen,
  automatically doing 10 (4d4) piercing damage. Then the
  swarm dies.
* The ceiling above one creature that the hive-queen can see
  within 120 feet of her drips sticky resin. The creature must
  make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be encased
  in rapidly-hardening resin. A creature encased this way is
  :ref:`srd:restrained`. It can free itself, or another creature within 5 feet
  can free it, by using an action to make a successful DC 15
  Strength check. If the creature is still encased the next time
  the initiative count reaches 20, the resin hardens, trapping it.
  The trapped creature can’t move or speak; attack rolls against
  it have disadvantage because it is encased in resin armor; it
  automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws; and
  it has resistance to all damage. The trapped creature is released
  when the resin is destroyed (AC 10, 20 HP, immune to cold,
  fire, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, and piercing damage).

The tosculi hive-queen can’t repeat an effect until they have all
been used, and she can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.

Regional Effects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The region containing a tosculi hive-queen’s lair is warped
by the creature’s presence, which creates one or more of the
following effects:

1. Intelligent creatures within 6 miles suffer frequent headaches.
   It’s as if they had a constant buzzing inside their heads.
2. Beasts within 6 miles are more irritable and violent than usual
   and have the Blood Frenzy trait:

   **Blood Frenzy.** The beast has advantage on melee attack rolls
   against a creature that doesn’t have all its hit points.

If the tosculi hive-queen dies, the buzzing disappears
immediately, and the beasts go back to normal within 1d10 days.
