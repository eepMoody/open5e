Tosculi Drone
-------------

Tosculi drones are the workers of the tosculi hive; the
smallest, weakest, least intelligent, and most abundant of
the wasp folk. Their carapaces are mostly iridescent blue
with gold abdomens and lower legs. A drone stands
between 3 and 4 feet tall, and weighs
around 50 lb. They have
only vestigial wings, so
they can glide but not
truly fly.

**One-Way Scouts.** Drones function primarily as menial workers
but, during time of war, they also act as highly expendable scouts
and soldiers. Because the warriors know whatever a drone knows
(thanks to the hive-queen), a drone doesn’t need to survive its
scouting mission to deliver useful information.

**Gliding Wings.** The tosculi drone can use its wings to slowly
descend when falling (as if under the effect of the feather
fall spell). It can move up to 5 feet horizontally for every foot
it falls. The tosculi drone can’t gain height with these wings
alone. If subjected to a strong wind or lift of any kind, it can
use the updraft to glide farther.

**Skittering.** Up to two tosculi can share the same space at one
time. The tosculi has advantage on melee attack rolls while
sharing its space with another tosculi that isn’t incapacitated.
