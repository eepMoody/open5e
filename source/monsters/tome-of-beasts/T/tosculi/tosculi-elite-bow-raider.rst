Tosculi Elite Bow Raider
------------------------

Tosculi elite bow raiders are smarter and more capable than
drones and common warriors, with midnight black or deep
green carapaces that shine with colorful iridescence. Their wings
are blood red, streaked with dark crimson veins. Elite bow
raiders also tower over common tosculi—they stand over 5 feet
tall and weigh 130 lb.

**Warband Leaders.** Elite bow raiders lead larger raiding
parties of warriors and drones to gather slaves and sacrifices. As
rare and prized members of the hive, a bow raider’s life is never
thrown away like drones’ or risked unnecessarily. Seldom does
a tosculi warband contain more than a handful of these elite
soldiers, and they frequently hold positions of command. Elite
bow raiders always lead the honor guard for their hive-queen,
both within the hive and on those rare occasions when the queen
ventures outside.
