Temple Dog
----------

*Looking like a mix between a large
dog and a lion, the creature glares at
everyone who passes the threshold of
the temple it guards.*

A temple dog is an imposing
guardian used by various deities
to protect their temples. They are
fiercely loyal and territorial. Often
depicted in temple statuary, the
creature has a largely canine body,
soft but short hair, a thick hairy
tail, and a mane like a lion’s around a
dog’s face with a short snout.

**Divine Colors.** Coloration and other
features of the temple dog vary to match
the deity who created it; sometimes a temple
dog’s coloration is quite fanciful. Greenish bronze
temple dogs are known, as are those the color
of cinnabar or lapis. Even coats resembling fired
ceramic of an orange hue have been seen guarding
some temples. These unusual casts make it easy for a
temple dog to be mistaken for statuary.

**Travel with Priests.** As a temple protector,
it rarely leaves the grounds of the temple to
which it has been attached, but temple
dogs do accompany priests or allies of
the temple during travel. The temple dog
cannot speak but understands most of
what’s said around it, and it can follow
moderately complex commands (up to
two sentences long) without supervision.

Temple dogs are notorious for biting
their prey, then shaking the victim
senseless in their massive jaws.
