Ancient Titan
-------------

*Radiating a powerful presence, this towering humanoid has sharp-edged
features that seem hewn from ancient stone.*

**Children of the Gods.** Ancient titans are the surviving
immortal children of an early primordial god. They fled to the
wilds after a divine war, where they founded an empire that lasted
thousands of years before plague brought about its collapse.

**Sea God’s Servants.** A few ancient titans still dwell in the
ocean realm, spared by the sea god in exchange for eternal
servitude. Ancient titans have long, glossy hair, usually black,
red, or silver, and they stand 60 feet tall and weigh over 20 tons.

**Friends to Dragons.** Ancient titans have a strong rapport
with wind and sea dragons, as well as gold, silver, and mithral
dragons.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The ancient titan’s spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 17). The ancient titan can innately cast
the following spells, requiring no material components:

**3/day:** :ref:`srd:power-word-stun`

**1/day:** :ref:`srd:power-word-kill`

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack:** The ancient titan makes two greatsword attacks
or two longbow attacks.

**Greatsword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target. *Hit:* 38 (8d6 + 8) slashing damage.

**Longbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range
150/640 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (4d8 + 1) piercing
damage.

**Eldritch Singularity (Recharge 5-6).** The
ancient titan opens a momentary rupture
in the eldritch source that fuels its words
of power. This rupture appears at a spot
designated by the titan within 100 feet.
Any creature within 60 feet of the spot
must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure,
the creature takes 28 (8d6) force damage, falls :ref:`srd:prone`, and is
pulled 1d6 x 10 feet toward the eldritch singularity, taking an
additional 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage per 10 feet they were
dragged. If the saving throw succeeds, the target takes half as
much force damage and isn’t knocked prone or pulled.
The spot where the rupture occurs becomes the center of
a 60-foot-radius antimagic field until the end of the ancient
titan’s next turn. The titan’s spells are not affected by this
antimagic field.
