Titan, Degenerate
-----------------

*This giant retains a look of daunting power despite its stooped
bearing, tattered clothing, and pieces of slapdash armor strapped
on wherever it fits.*

**Haunt Ruins.** The degenerate descendants of once-noble
titans haunt the ruins where their cities once flourished.
They hunt for any living thing to eat, including each
other, and sometimes chase after herds of goats
or other animals for miles. While they are easily
distracted, they always find their way home unerringly.

**Insane and Moody.** Degenerate titans are prone
to insanity and unexpected mood shifts. They are
fiercely territorial creatures who worship the still-active
magical devices of their cities and any surviving statuary
as if they were gods. Their lairs are filled with items
scavenged from the city. These collections are a hodgepodge of dross and delight, as the degenerate titans are not
intelligent enough to discern treasure from trash.

**Primal Power.** Degenerate titans cannot command magical
words of power, but they have tapped into the earth's latent
mystic power to generate strange geomancy. These devolved
misfits may have lost most of their former gifts, but what
remains are primal powers that tap, without subtlety or skill,
into the fundamental building blocks of magic.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack:** The degenerate titan makes two greatclub attacks.

**Greatclub.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 29 (4d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

**Earthstrike (Recharge 4-6).** The degenerate titan slams his
fists onto the ground, creating a shockwave in a line 60 feet
long and 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line takes 35
(10d6) force damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the
titan and knocked prone; a successful DC 18 Dexterity saving
throw halves the damage and prevents the creature from
being flung or knocked prone. A creature thatâ€™s flung against
an unyielding object such as a wall or floor takes 3 (1d6)
bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If it
collides with another creature, that creature must succeed on
a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage (1d6
bludgeoning per 10 feet) and be knocked prone.

**Shout of the Void (Recharge 4-6).** The degenerate titan utters
a scream that rends reality in a 30-foot cone. Any ongoing spell
or magical effect of 3rd level or lower in the area ends. For every
spell or effect of 4th level or higher in the area, the degenerate
titan makes a Constitution check against DC (10 + the level of
the spell or effect). On a success, the spell or effect ends.
