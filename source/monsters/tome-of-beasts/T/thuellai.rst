Thuellai
--------

*This raging cloud of animate mist and ice has icicle shards for eyes
and claws. In battle or when hunting, a thuellai howls like a dozen
screaming banshees.*

**Servants of Boreas.** These fast-flying creatures of air and
ice were created by the lord of the north wind, Boreas, to be
his heralds, assassins, and hunting hounds. They appear as a
swirling blizzard, often blending in with snowstorms to surprise
their victims.

**Terrifying Blizzards.** Thuellai love to engulf creatures in
their blizzards, to lash buildings with ice and cold, and to trigger
avalanches with their whirlwinds. They thrive on destruction and
fear, and they share their master’s unpredictable nature.

**Immune to Steel.** Northerners especially fear the thuellai
because of their resistance to mundane steel, their terrifying
howls, and their ability to cause madness.

**Elemental Nature.** A thuellali doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The thuellai makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) slashing damage plus 26 (4d12) cold damage.
If the target is wearing metal armor, it must make a successful
DC 17 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of :ref:`srd:exhaustion`.

**Freezing Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The thuellai exhales an
icy blast in a 40-foot cone. Each target in the area takes 39
(6d12) cold damage, or half damage with a successful DC 17
Constitution saving throw.

**Algid Aura.** All creatures within 10 feet of a thuellai take 7 (2d6)
cold damage at the beginning of the thuellai’s turn. Spells or
magical effects that protect against cold are affected as if by
a :ref:`srd:dispel-magic` spell (the thuellai’s effective spellcasting bonus
is +5) if a thuellai is within 20 feet of the target at the start of
the thuellai’s turn, and nonmagical flames within 20 feet of the
thuellai are extinguished at the start of its turn.

**Howl of the Maddening Wind (3/day).** A thuellai’s howl can
cause creatures to temporarily lose their minds and even to
attack themselves or their companions. Each target within
100 feet of the thuellai and able to hear the howl must make
a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or roll 1d8 and
consult the table below at the start of its next turn. An affected
creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns; a success ends the effect on itself, but a failure means it
must roll again on the table below at the start of its next turn.

2-4 Do nothing but babble incoherently
5-6 Do 1d8 damage + Str modifier to self with item in hand
7-8 Attack nearest target; select randomly if more than one
=== =======================================================

**Blizzard (1/Day).** The thuellai creates an icy blizzard in the area
around it. A 50-foot radius sphere surrounding the thuellai fills
with icy fog, whirling snow, and driving ice crystals. Vision is
lightly obscured, and creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on vision or hearing. The ground
in the affected area becomes difficult terrain. The effect lasts
for 10 minutes and moves with the thuellai.
