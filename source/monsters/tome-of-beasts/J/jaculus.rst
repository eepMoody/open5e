Jaculus
-------

*This small dragon has feathered wings on its forearms
and powerful legs it uses to cling to trees.*

The jaculus (plural jaculi), is a draconic
predator that roams the forest and jungle
looking for valuable objects it can add to
its hoard. Also called the javelin snake,
a jaculus loves shiny or reflective
items, and it is clever enough to
identify items of real value. It
will fight and kill to take items it
desires, which it stashes inside
hollow trees far from any forest
trail.

**Leapers.** Jaculi are far better
jumpers than flyers. They can
jump 18 feet horizontally or 12
feet vertically after taking a single
2-foot step. They even climb faster
than they fly, so they use their
wings to flap clumsily back into the
trees only when necessary.

**Teamwork Thievery.** Jaculi
are among the least intelligent
of the dragons—but they’re still
smarter than most humans, and
they’re known to pursue cunning and
complicated plots to build their hoards.
Many traditional tales tell of jaculi in
the southern forests working as teams to
separate merchants and other travelers from
their wealth, figuring out ways to abscond with
gems and jewelry before the owners even know
they’ve been robbed. Some jaculi may feign docility
or even pretend to be friendly and helpful, but wise
travelers know that the creatures drop such ruses as soon
as they can steal what they’re really after.
