Mallqui
-------

*With skin stretched like vellum over wizened limbs, a desiccated
humanoid form clad in splendid regalia emerges from a funerary
tower. Suddenly, the air becomes so dry as to make the eyes sting and
lips crack. The imposing figure has yellow points of light for eyes.*

**Cold Plateau Mummies.** The people of the cold, rainless,
mountain plateaus take advantage of their dry climes to
mummify their honored dead, but without the embalming and
curing of the corpse practiced in hotter lands. To preserve the
knowledge and the place of their ancestors in the afterlife,
their dead remain among them as counsellors and honorees
on holy days.

**Undead Judges.** The mallqui are not seen as malevolent,
though at times they are severe judges against transgressors of
their culture’s ideals.

**Icons of Growth.** Through their ability to draw the very
moisture from the air, they are seen as conduits to the fertility of
the earth. “Mallqui” also means “sapling” in the language of the
people who create them.

**Undead Nature.** A mallqui doesn’t require air, food, drink,
or sleep.

**Regeneration.** The mallqui regains 10 hit points at the start of
its turn. If the mallqui takes damage from its Water Sensitivity
trait, its regeneration doesn’t function at the start of the
mallqui’s next turn. The mallqui dies only if it starts its turn with
0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The mallqui’s innate spellcasting ability is
Wisdom (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can
cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** druidcraft, produce flame

**4/day each:** create or destroy water, entangle

**2/day:** locate animals or plants

**1/day each:** dispel magic, plant growth, wind wall

**Water Sensitivity.** The flesh of a mallqui putrefies and dissolves
rapidly when soaked with water in the following ways:

* Splashed with a waterskin or equivalent: 1d10 damage
* Attacked by creature made of water: Normal damage plus
  an extra 1d10 damage
* Caught in rain: 2d10 damage per round (DC 11 Dexterity
  saving throw for half)
* Immersed in water: 4d10 damage per round (DC 13
  Dexterity saving throw for half)

Alternatively, the saving throw and DC of the spell used to
conjure or control the water damaging the mallqui can be used
in place of the saving throws above.
