Millitaur
---------

*The millitaur is a purplish-black
segmented worm the size of a horse, with
hundreds of legs, black multifaceted eyes
and thick powerful mandibles. They wield
crude stone axes.*

**Mulch Eaters.** Millitaurs roam jungles
and woodlands, where dense undergrowth rots
beneath the canopy and piles high; leaves and
plants provide much of the millitaur diet. Though
millitaurs are territorial, they sometimes chase away
threats rather than kill intruders. However, they also
are good hunters and supplement their diet with squirrel,
monkey, and even gnome or goblin.

**Poisonous Drool.** As formidable as they appear, millitaurs are
the preferred prey of some dragons and jungle giants, and tosculi
often hunt them for use as slaves and pack animals. In defense,
they’ve developed a mild poison. Millitaur handaxes often drip
with this substance, smeared onto them from the beast’s
mandibles. They use their axes for breaking up mulch for
easier digestion, as well as using them for hunting
and self-defense.

**Clicking Speech.** Millitaurs communicate
via body language, antennae movements,
scent, and clicking sounds. Although they
have no voice boxes, millitaurs can make
sounds by artfully clicking and grinding
their mandibles, and they can mimic
the sounds of Common in a peculiar
popping tone. They can be good
sources for local information so long
as they are treated with respect and
their territory is not encroached.
