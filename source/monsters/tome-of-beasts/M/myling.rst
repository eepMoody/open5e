Myling
------

*Mylings are the souls of the unburied, those who died in the forest
from abandonment or exposure and can find no peace until their
bodies are properly interred. Given the circumstances around their
deaths, mylings tend to be solitary. They haunt the places where
they died. When some tragedy resulted in multiple
deaths, the resulting mylings stay together and hunt as
a pack.*

**Attack in a Rage.** Mylings prefer to attack lone
wanderers, but they target a group when desperate or
when there’s more than one myling in the pack. They shadow
a target until after dark, then jump onto the target’s back and
demand to be carried to their chosen burial ground. They cling
tightly to a victim with arms and legs locked around the victim’s
shoulders and midsection, begging, threatening, and biting until
the victim gives in to their demands. Mylings will bite victims to
death if they are unable or unwilling to carry them, or if a victim
moves too slowly.

**Ungrateful Rest.** While all mylings seek a creature to carry
them to their final resting place, even when a chosen “mount” is
willing to carry the myling, the creature’s body grows immensely
heavier as it nears its burial place. Once there, it sinks into the
earth, taking its bearers with it. Being buried alive is their reward
for helping the myling.

**Urchin Rhymes and Songs.** Some mylings maintain traces
of the personalities they had while alive— charming, sullen, or
sadistic—and they can speak touchingly and piteously. Dressed
in ragged clothing, their skin blue with cold, they sometimes
reach victims who believe they are helping an injured child or
young adult. They hide their faces and sing innocent rhymes
when they aren’t screeching in fury, for they know that their dead
eyes and cold blue skin cause fright and alarm.

**Undead Nature.** A myling doesn’t require air, food, drink, or
sleep.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The myling makes one bite and two claw attacks.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage, and the target is grappled
(escape DC 12). If the target was grappled by the myling at the
start of the myling’s turn, the bite attack hits automatically.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 8 (2d6 + 1) slashing damage.

**Buried Alive.** If the myling starts its turn on its chosen burial
ground, it sinks into the earth. If it has a creature grappled, that
creature sinks with the myling. A Medium or larger creature
sinks up to its waist; a Small creature sinks up to its neck. If the
myling still has the victim grappled at the start of the myling’s
next turn, both of them disappear into the earth. While buried
this way, a creature is considered stunned. It can free itself
with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, but only
one check is allowed; if it fails, the creature is powerless to aid
itself except with magic. The creature must also make a DC
10 Constitution saving throw; if it succeeds, the creature has a
lungful of air and can hold its breath for (Constitution modifier
+ 1) minutes before suffocation begins. Otherwise, it begins
suffocating immediately. Allies equipped with digging tools
can reach it in four minutes divided by the number of diggers;
someone using an improvised tool (a sword, a plate, bare
hands) counts as only one-half of a digger.
