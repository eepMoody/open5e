Mi-Go
-----

*Mi-go have been described as “vaguely insectlike,” but
the emphasis belongs on “vaguely.” They have stubby
wings, multiple limbs, and nightmarish heads, but the
resemblance ends there.*

The mi-go are a space-faring race of great skill and vast
malevolence. They travel in large numbers between worlds,
somehow folding space to cover astronomical distances in
months rather than decades.

**Alien Technology.** Their technology includes mastery of
living things, powerful techniques to implant mi-go elements
and even minds in alien bodies (or to extract them), and an
unparalleled mastery of living tissue in both plant and animal
form. While they have their own secrets and goals, they also
serve ancient powers from between the stars and carry on an
interstellar effort to conquer and spread their species.

**World Colonizers.** The mi-go are devoted followers of
Shub-Niggurath, the goddess of fecundity and growth, and take
their evangelical mission extremely seriously. They colonize
entire worlds in Shub-Niggurath’s name, and they plant and
harvest entire species according to her will.

**Brain Cylinders.** One of the apexes of mi-go technology
is the brain cylinder, a device that permits the extraction and
maintenance of a living brain outside the body. Safely isolated in
a mi-go cylinder, a human brain can be transported between the
stars, sheltered—mostly—from the psyche-crushing effects of
interstellar space. They deploy, fill, and retrieve these cylinders
according to schedules and for purposes mysterious to others.
Indeed, most of their technology appears either revolting or
simply bizarre to humanoids (plant folk are less disquieted by
their functioning).

Mi-go merchants exchange psychic tools, surgical instruments,
and engineered materials such as solar wings, illuminating
lampfruit, and purple starvines (which induce sleep).

**Astral Travelers.** Mi-go do not require air or heat to survive,
only sunlight (and very little of that). They can enter a
sporulated form capable of surviving travel through the void
and returning to consciousness when conditions are right.

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn).** The mi-go does an extra 7 (2d6)
damage when it hits a target with a claw attack and has
advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet
of an ally of the mi-go that isn’t incapacitated and the mi-go
doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

**Disquieting Technology.** The mi-go are a highly advanced race,
and may carry items of powerful technology. Mi-go technology
can be represented using the same rules as magic items, but
their functions are very difficult to determine: identify is useless,
but an hour of study and a successful DC 19 Arcana check can
reveal the purpose and proper functioning of a mi‑go item.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The mi-go makes two attacks with its claws.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage, and the target is grappled
(escape DC 13). If both claw attacks strike the same target in
a single turn, the target takes an additional 13 (2d12) psychic
damage.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Spore Release.** When a mi-go dies, it releases its remaining
spores. All living creatures within 10 feet take 14 (2d8 + 5)
poison damage and become poisoned; a successful DC 16
Constitution saving throw halves the damage and prevents
poisoning. A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the
end of its turn, ending the effect on itself with a success.
