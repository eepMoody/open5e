Monolith Champion
-----------------

*This suit of armor stands motionless, its visor raised to reveal a
black skull with eyes cold as a winter moon. A cloak of owl feathers
hangs from its shoulders, and a greatsword is slung across its back.*

**Beautiful Constructs.** Monolithic servitors are constructs
designed to serve the courts of the shadow fey. As constructs
go, these are uncommonly beautiful; they are meant to be
as pleasing to the eyes as they are functional. Beauty, of
course, is in the eye of the beholder, and what’s beautiful
in the eyes of the shadow fey might be considered
strange, disturbing, or even alarming by mortal folk.

**Expensive Armor.** Regardless of a viewer’s esthetic
opinion, it’s obvious that a monolith champion
incorporates amazing workmanship. Every fitting is
perfect; every surface is masterfully burnished and
etched with detail almost invisible to the naked
eye or decorated with macabre inlays and precious
chasing. The skull in the helmet is mere decoration,
meant to frighten the weak of heart and mislead
opponents into thinking the champion is some form
of undead rather than a pure construct.

**Keeping Out the Rabble.** As its name
implies, the monolith champion serves as a
guardian, warrior, or sentry. In those roles, it
never tires, never becomes distracted or bored,
never questions its loyalty, and never swerves
from its duty. It delights in throwing non-fey
visitors out of fey settlements and buildings.

**Constructed Nature.** A monolith
champion doesn’t require air, food, drink,
or sleep.

**Blatant Dismissal.** While in a fey court or castle, a monolith
champion that scores a successful hit with its greatsword
can try to force the substitution of the target with a shadow
double. The target must succeed at a DC 14 Charisma saving
throw or become invisible, silent, and paralyzed, while an
illusory version of itself remains visible and audible—and
under the monolith champion’s control, shouting for a retreat
or the like. Outside fey locales, this ability does not function.

**Fey Flame.** The ritual powering a monolith champion grants
it an inner flame that it can use to enhance its weapon or its
fists with additional fire or cold damage, depending on the
construct’s needs.
