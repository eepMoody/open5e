Venemous Mummy
--------------

*This shambling corpse warrior is draped in stained linen
wrappings. Green liquid drips from rents in the fabric.*

**Servant of the Scorpion Goddess.** These mummies are
crafted by Selket’s faithful to guard holy sites and tombs and
to serve as agents of the goddess’s retribution. Should Selket
or her faithful feel themselves slighted by an individual or a
community, they perform dangerous rituals to awaken these
creatures from the crypts of her temples. Venomous mummies
delight in wreaking deadly vengeance against those who
disrespect the goddess.

**Death to Blasphemers.** In most cases, retribution is limited
to people who actually undertook the acts of blasphemy, but
if her priests determine that an entire community has grown
heretical and earned Selket’s wrath, they may set mummies
loose against the entire populace.

**Deadly Smoke.** Burning a venomous mummy is a terrible
idea; the smoke of their immolation is toxic.

**Selket’s Venom.** The venomous mummy’s body and wrappings
are magically imbued with substances that are highly toxic.
Any creature that comes in physical contact with the
venomous mummy (e.g., touching the mummy bare-handed,
grappling, using a bite attack) must succeed
on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned
with Selket’s venom. The poisoned target takes 3 (1d6)
poison damage every 10 minutes. Selket’s venom is a
curse, so it lasts until ended by the remove curse spell
or comparable magic.

**Toxic Smoke.** The venomous mummy’s poison-imbued
wrappings and flesh create toxic fumes
when burned. If a venomous mummy takes fire
damage, it is surrounded by a cloud of
toxic smoke in a 10-foot radius. This
cloud persists for one full round. A
creature that starts its turn inside the cloud or enters it for the
first time on its turn takes 14 (4d6) poison damage, or half
damage with a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw.
