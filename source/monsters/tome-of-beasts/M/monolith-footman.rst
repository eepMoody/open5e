Monolith Footman
----------------

*A suit of elven parade armor, beautifully ornate but perhaps not
terribly functional, stands at attention.*

**Beautiful Construct.** Like the monolith champion,
a monolith footman is an esthetic triumph in the
construct‑builder’s craft. If anything, form takes a higher priority
in the footman than function, since their function is largely to
look fine as they stand ready to perform servant’s duties for their
shadow fey masters.

**More Servant than Warrior.** Because it’s fashioned as
grand armor, the footman looks more ferocious than it is. Its
fighting ability is nothing to dismiss, but
fighting is not its primary function. It’s
a combination of household servant
and watchdog with imposing martial
flair. Like the champion, a monolith
footman’s most alarming power is
its ability to replace an opponent
with a shadow double. This threat
should be taken seriously by strangers
to shadow as they weigh the risks of
causing trouble in the fey courts.

**Perfect Loyalty.** Monolith footmen
follow orders to the letter and are unswerving
in their loyalty.

**Constructed Nature.** A monolith footman
doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Blatant Dismissal.** While in the courts or castles of the fey,
a monolith footman that scores a successful hit with its
longsword can try to force the substitution of the target
with a shadow double. The target must succeed at a DC
10 Charisma saving throw or become invisible, silent,
and paralyzed, while an illusory version of itself remains
visible and audible—and under the monolith footman’s
control, shouting for a retreat or the like. Outside fey locales,
this ability does not function.

**Fey Flame.** The ritual powering a monolith footman grants it
an inner flame that it can use to enhance its weapon or its
fists with additional fire or cold damage, depending on the
construct’s needs.

**Simple Construction.** Monolith footmen are designed with
a delicate fey construction. They burst into pieces and are
destroyed when they receive a critical hit.
