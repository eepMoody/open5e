Malphas
-------

*Keen eyed and dangerous, a malphas is a winged fey warrior,
dressed in finery. Her longsword often sport an ornate pommel or
a rich scabbard. Among the fey, they are often referred as storm
crows, meaning bearers of bad news.*

**Sworn to the Shadow Fey.** Raised with a sword in their
hands, the malphas are fierce warriors who serve the aristocracy
of the shadow fey unswervingly.

**Messengers.** Laconic in speech, they nevertheless serve as
envoys and messengers from time to time, though as much or
more is communicated by the choice in messenger as in the
message itself.
