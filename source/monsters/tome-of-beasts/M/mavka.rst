Mavka
-----

*These twisted dryads have been turned into vampiric monstrosities
by undead warlocks and vampiric experiments.*

**Charred Dryads.** With burnt and blackened skin, burnt twigs
for hair, and clawed hands and feet that resemble burnt and
twisted roots, mavkas seem scorched and even frail. Pupil-less
red eyes gleam in their eye sockets with a hellish green flame.

**Death Riders.** All mavkas ride :ref:`srd:nightmare` mounts as fearsome
raiders, often snatching victims up into the saddle, never to be
seen again. They despise and trample foot soldiers as peasants
unworthy of attention.

**Hag Killers.** Mavkas are the mortal enemies of the :ref:`red hags <tob:red-hag>`, who
call these undead horrors “greenbanes.”

**Undead Nature.** A mavka doesn’t require air, food, drink,
or sleep.
