Deathcap Myconid
----------------

*Deathcap flesh ranges from white to pale gray to a warm yellow-orange.
Their heads resemble fungal caps, often either red with
white spots, red at the center with a brown edge, or a bluish-purple
tone. Although deathcaps have vicious-looking fanged mouths, they
use them only to ingest earth or mineral nutrients.*

**Mushroom Farmers.** These sentient mushroom folk tend
the white forests of fungi in the underworld and are allies of the
darakhul. Despite their ominous name, deathcap myconids are
chiefly farmers. They cultivate dozens of species of mushrooms
anywhere they have water, dung, and a bit of earth or slime in
the underworld deeps. For this reason, other races rarely attack
them. The ghouls do not eat them, and they cannot be made
into darakhul.

**Toxic Spores.** Although deathcaps are mostly peaceful, their
spores are toxic and sleep-inducing. They make excellent allies
in combat because their abilities tend to punish attackers, but
they aren’t especially lethal on their own. They use their poison
and slumber spores to full effect against living creatures; they
typically flee from constructs and undead. They count on their
allies (carrion beetles, darakhul, purple worms, dark creepers,
or even various devils) to fend off the most powerful foes.

**Clones.** Deathcap myconids live in communal groups of
related clones. They reproduce asexually, and an elder and its
offspring can be nearly identical in all but age. These clone
groups are called deathcap rings.

Myconids build no huts or towns, but their groups are
defined by their crops and general appearance. Indeed,
many sages claim that the deathcaps are merely the
fruiting, mobile bodies of the forests they tend, and
that this is why they fight so ferociously to defend
their forests of giant fungi.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The myconid uses either its Deathcap Spores or its
Slumber Spores, then makes a fist attack.

**Fist.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (4d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (4d4) poison
damage.

**Deathcap Spores (3/day).** The myconid ejects spores at one
creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed
on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be :ref:`srd:poisoned` for 3
rounds. While poisoned this way, the target also takes 10 (4d4)
poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The target
repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
the effect on itself on a success.

**Slumber Spores (3/day).** The myconid ejects spores at one
creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed
on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be :ref:`srd:poisoned` and
:ref:`srd:unconscious` for 1 minute. A creature wakes up if it takes
damage, or if another creature uses its action to shake it awake.
