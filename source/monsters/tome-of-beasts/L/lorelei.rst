Lorelei
-------

*Lounging on large river rocks or within swirling eddies untouched
by the rush of the current, these breathtakingly fey call plaintively
to travelers and knights errant. They seek nothing less than the last
breath of a drowning man.*

**Death to Men.** These callous river sirens compete with one
another in manipulating and destroying male travelers. A race
born from an ancient oath to the River King, a lorelei’s cruelty
stems from a racial memory. A lorelei often taunts her prey for
days before finally turning on it. When the opportunity presents
itself, it quickly draws heavily armored warriors into deep water
and kisses them as they drown.

**Voluptuous Humanoids.** Although legends describe the
lorelei as golden-haired and fair-skinned, they come in all
varieties, each more voluptuous than the next. While most
resemble sensual humans, a lorelei’s form can also include
elves, dwarves, and in some recorded cases even orcs and
hobgoblins—a lorelei mimics her most frequent prey.

**Ignore Women.** Women travelers are vexing for the lorelei.
While the siren’s powers affect women as readily as men, the
lorelei lacks the urge to destroy them. Women traveling alone or
in all-female groups may pass through a lorelei’s territory safely,
and might even make peaceful contact. However, women who
protect male companions are viewed as traitors, inspiring wrath.

**Alluring Presence.** All humanoids within 30 feet of a lorelei who
look directly at her must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving
throw or be drawn to her in the most direct path, regardless of
the danger. This compulsion fades once the person gets within
5 feet of the lorelei. A creature can avoid this effect for one full
round by choosing to avert its eyes at the start of its turn, but
it then has disadvantage on any attacks or other rolls directed
against the lorelei until the start of its next turn. A lorelei can
suppress or resume this ability as a bonus action. Anyone who
successfully saves against this effect cannot be affected by it
from the same lorelei for 24 hours.

**Unearthly Grace.** A lorelei applies her Charisma modifier to all
of her saving throws in place of the normal ability modifier.

**Water Spirit.** The lorelei is under the effect of freedom of
movement whenever she is in contact with a body of water.

**Spellcasting.** The lorelei is an 8th-level spellcaster. Her
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with
spell attacks). She requires no material components to cast her
spells. The lorelei has the following sorcerer spells prepared:

**Cantrips (at will):** :ref:`srd:detect-magic`, :ref:`srd:guidance`, :ref:`srd:light`, :ref:`srd:mending`,
:ref:`srd:poison-spray`, :ref:`srd:prestidigitation`

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Dagger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage.

**Charm.** The lorelei targets one humanoid she can see within
30 feet of her. If the target can see or hear the lorelei, it must
succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic
or be :ref:`srd:charmed` by the lorelei. The charmed target regards
the lorelei as its one, true love, to be heeded and protected.
Although the target isn’t under the lorelei’s control, it takes the
lorelei’s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can.

Each time the lorelei or her companions cause the target to
take damage, directly or indirectly, it repeats the saving throw,
ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect
lasts 24 hours or until the lorelei is killed, is on a different
plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to
end the effect.

**Stunning Glance.** The lorelei mentally disrupts a creature
within 30 feet with a look. The target must succeed on a DC 17
Wisdom saving throw or be :ref:`srd:stunned` for 2 rounds. Anyone who
successfully saves against this effect cannot be affected by it
from the same lorelei for 24 hours.
