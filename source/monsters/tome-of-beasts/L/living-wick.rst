Living Wick
-----------

*A living wick is a small, rough wax sculpture of a human that
stands at attention, a halo of light flickering around its head from
some source behind it.*

**Enchanted Wicks.** Living wicks are obedient wax statues
brought to life by an enchanted wick that runs from the nape of
their neck to their lower back. When new, a living wick looks and
moves like a human, but as the wick burns, the wax features melt
and the statue takes on a twisted, hunchbacked appearance.

**Short-Lived as a Candle.** Living wicks are powered by
flames, and therefore they have a predetermined life cycle.
They are typically reduced to formless lumps in a month, but
some say a living wick’s affordability more than makes up for its
inevitable obsolescence. Individuals looking to quickly construct
a building or fortification without the expense of paid labor or
the questionable ethics of necromancy find living wicks obedient
and efficient, as do those needing an army for a single battle.
Living wicks are active only when their wicks are lit, and only
respond to the telepathic commands of whoever lit them. This
makes it easy to transfer living wicks between owners, even those
not well-versed in the use of magic.

**Explosive Ends.** The amount of magical energy contained
within a living wick, paired with the manner in which it
is released, gives them a remarkable capability for self-destruction.
If their controller demands it, all living wicks
can release the magic contained within their form all at once,
engulfing themselves and anyone nearby in flames. This can
make storing them a gamble, but many see it as an asset,
especially those seeking to destroy evidence or anonymously
attack their enemies.

**Constructed Nature.** A living wick doesn’t require air,
food, drink, or sleep.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.

**Consume Self.** A living wick can be commanded to rapidly burn
through the remains of its wick, creating a devastating fireball.
All creatures within 20 feet of the living wick take 7 (2d6) fire
damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity
saving throw. The fire spreads around corners and ignites
flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.
The wick is reduced to a lifeless puddle of wax.
