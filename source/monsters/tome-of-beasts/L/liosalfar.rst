Liosalfar
---------

*The curtain of rippling colors assumes a humanoid form. Its
kaleidoscope body shifts and glitters with mesmeric patterns.*

Sometimes known as “light elves” because they assume a vaguely
elfish shape, these enigmatic shapeshifters make their home
at the edge of the world, where reality bends and physical laws
unravel. Their mutable bodies are composed entirely of shifting
colors. Among themselves they communicate through flashing
patterns and hues, but they talk to other races in an echoing,
choral tone that seems to emanate from everywhere and
nowhere around them.

**Servants of Fate.** Their aims often seem inconsequential or
simply baffling, but they’ve also sundered mountains and toppled
kingdoms. Many believe they’re agents of Fate, others that their
motivation is an alien aesthetic or their own amusement.

**Pattern Vision.** Those who’ve spoken with liosalfar say they
talk as if all existence was a sea of patterns and colors to be set in
pleasing shapes. They barely understand mortal concerns.

**Enemies of the Ramag.** The liosalfar have a longstanding
rivalry with the portal-making :ref:`tob:ramag`, whom they despise as
“corruptors of the patterns.”

**Elemental Nature.** A liosalfar doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

**Alien Mentality.** A liosalfar’s exotic consciousness renders
it immune to psychic effects, and any attempt to read their
thoughts leaves the reader confused as per the :ref:`srd:confusion` spell for 1 round.

**Darkness Vulnerability.** Magical darkness is harmful to a
liosalfar: They take 2d10 necrotic damage, or half damage with
a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw, each time they
start their turn inside magical darkness. Natural darkness is
unpleasant to them but not harmful.

**Incorporeal Movement.** The
liosalfar can move through other
creatures and objects as difficult
terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force
damage if it ends its turn inside
an object.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The
liosalfar’s innate spellcasting
ability is Intelligence (spell
save DC 15, +7 to hit
with spell attacks).
It can innately cast
the following spells,
requiring no material
components:

**At Will:** :ref:`srd:augury`, :ref:`srd:color-spray`,
:ref:`srd:dancing-lights`, :ref:`srd:detect-magic`,
*flare*, :ref:`srd:light`, :ref:`srd:silent-image`,
:ref:`srd:spare-the-dying`

**2/day each:** :ref:`srd:alter-self`, :ref:`srd:blur`,
:ref:`srd:divination`, :ref:`srd:hypnotic-pattern`,
:ref:`srd:prismatic-spray`, :ref:`srd:scorching-ray`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:hallucinatory-terrain`, :ref:`srd:plane-shift`, :ref:`srd:sunbeam`

**Lightform.** Liosalfar are
composed entirely of light. They
are incorporeal and not subject
to ability damage, polymorph,
petrification, or attacks that
alter their form.

**Prismatic Glow.** Liosalfar
shed rainbow illumination
equal to a daylight spell. They cannot
extinguish this glow without perishing but
can reduce it to the level of torchlight at will. Even when using
alter self they have a faint, diffused glow that’s visible in dim
light or darkness.

succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:stunned`
for 1 round.
