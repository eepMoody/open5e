Broodiken
---------

*Tiny and built like a caricature of a person, this creature’s
enlarged head is filled with pointed teeth.*

**Bodily Children.** Broodikens are crude servants created
by humanoid spellcasters willing to grow them within their
own bodies. They resemble their creators in the most obvious
ways, with the same number of limbs and basic features,
but all broodikens stand one foot tall with overly
large heads and heavily fanged mouths.
Those born to monstrous humanoids
with wings or horns have ineffective,
decorative versions that do not help the
creature fly or fight.

**Emotional Echoes.** Broodikens have
little personality of their own and respond
to their creators’ emotions, growling
when their creators feel anger and babbling
happily when their creators feel joy. When their
creators are more than 100 feet away, they cry loudly with
a sound that resembles children of the creator’s own species. If
discovered crying by anyone other than their creator, they attack.
When their creators focus their anger on specific individuals,
the broodikens attack as a group, using Stealth to get close and
overwhelm single opponents.

**Born With Daggers.** Broodikens are created by eating the
heart of a dead broodiken. Once this “seed” is consumed,
2d4 broodikens grow inside of the “mother” or creator.
Nurturing the growing brood requires consuming specific
muds, ashes, and plants, which cost 50 gp/day for each
incubating broodiken. The incubation period requires one
month and takes a toll on the creator’s health. During this time,
the creator becomes fatigued after four hours without eight
hours’ rest.

If the creator is not a spellcaster, a spellcaster who meets the
requirements below must supervise the incubation and birth.
Most spellcasters birth the broodiken using a dagger before
the broodiken tears its way out. A “mother” can only control
one brood of broodiken at a time. Incubating a second brood
makes the first brood furiously jealous, and it will turn on its
own creator.

**Constructed Nature.** A broodiken doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

**Immutable Form.** The broodiken is immune to any spell or

**Magic Resistance.** The broodiken has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Shared Rage.** A broodiken cannot speak with its creator
telepathically, but it feels strong emotions and recognizes
the objects of those emotions. A creator can telepathically
order broodiken to hunt for and attack individuals by sending
the broodiken an image of the creature and the appropriate
emotion. As long as the broodiken is on such a hunt, it can be
more than 100 feet away from its master without wailing.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage.

**Attach.** When a broodiken succeeds on a bite attack, its teeth
latch on, and the target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 9). On each of
its turns, its bite attack hits automatically as long as it can
maintain its grapple.
