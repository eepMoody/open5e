Bagiennik
---------

*With webbed claws, bulbous eyes, and two nostril-slits that ooze
an oily black substance, the creature is not quite hideous—but it
might be, if most of it wasn’t concealed by a thick coating of muck
and mud.*

**Bathing Uglies.** When a bagiennik is alone, it spends its time
bathing in local springs, rivers, and marshes. The creature sifts
through the muck and silt, extracting substances that enhance
its oily secretions. If anything disturbs the creature during
its languorous bathing sessions, it angrily retaliates. Once a
bagiennik has bathed for four hours it seeks a target for
mischief or charity.

**Unpredictable Moods.** One never knows what
to expect with a bagiennik. The same creature might
aid an injured traveler one day, smear that person
with corrosive, acidic oil the next day, and then
extend tender care to the burned victim of its own
psychotic behavior.

If the creature feels beneficent, it heals injured animals
or even diseased or injured villagers. If a bagiennik visits a
settlement, the ill and infirm approach it cautiously while
everyone else hides to avoid provoking its wrath.

When a bagiennik leaves its bath in an
angry mood, it raves and seeks out animals or
humanoids to spray its oil onto. If a victim drops
to 0 hit points, the foul-tempered bagiennik
applies healing oil to stabilize them, grumbling all
the while.

**Acid Oils.** Collecting a dead bagiennik’s black
oils must be done within an hour of the creature’s
death. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check yields one
vial of acid, or two vials if the result was 20 or higher.

A bagiennik can use these chemicals either to heal or to harm,
but no alchemist or healer has figured out how to reproduce the
healing effects. Other than their acidic effect, the secretions lose
all potency within moments of being removed from a bagiennik.

A bagiennik weighs 250 lb., plus a coating of 20 to 50 lb. of
mud and muck.

**Healing Oil.** A bagiennik can automatically stabilize a dying
creature by using an action to smear some of its oily secretion
on the dying creature’s flesh. A similar application on an
already-stable creature or one with 1 or more hit points acts as
a potion of healing, restoring 2d4 + 2 hit points. Alternatively,
the bagiennik’s secretion can have the effect of a lesser
restoration spell. However, any creature receiving a bagiennik’s
Healing Oil must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving
throw or be slowed for 1 minute.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The bagiennik makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 18 (4d6 + 4) slashing damage.

**Acid Spray.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 15 ft.,
one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d10 + 3) acid damage. The target must
make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone
in the slick oil, which covers an area 5 feet square. A creature
that enters the oily area or ends its turn there must also make
the Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling prone. A creature
needs to make only one saving throw per 5-foot-square per
turn, even if it enters and ends its turn in the area. The slippery
effect lasts for 3 rounds.
