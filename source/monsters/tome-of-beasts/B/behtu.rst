Behtu
-----

*With the face of a mandrill and the tusks of a great boar, these
ferocious half-ape, half-human pygmies have demon blood flowing
in their veins. Only the desperate or the suicidal travel to their
volcanic temple-islands.*

Mechuiti (meh-CHOO-ee-tee), the demon lord of apes,
cannibalism, and torture, combines the cruelty of a demon with
the cunning of a human and the ferocity of an ape. He bred the
same qualities into his people, the behtu (BAY-too), who carry
his worship from island to island.

**Temple Builders.** The behtus raise shrines to Mechuiti
wherever they go. Some are kept and prosper, while others fall
into decay and return to the jungle.

**Ichor Drinkers.** In his volcanic temples, Mechuitiâ€™s idols
weep his ichorous demon blood, which the behtus use to create
infusions that give them inhuman strength and speed. The
behtus also use the infusions to etch demonic tattoos that grant
them infernal powers and protection.

**Scaly Mounts.** The behtus breed demonic iguanas as war
mounts (treat as giant lizards). The most powerful behtu
sorcerers and druids have been known to ride large crimson
drakes and small flame dragons as personal mounts.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

**Shortspear.** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit,
reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 +
3) piercing damage.

**Fire Breath (Recharge 6).** The behtu exhales fire
in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area takes
21 (5d8) fire damage, or half damage with a
successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.

**Ichorous Infusions.** Behtu war parties carry 1d6
vials of ichorous infusions. They often ingest an
infusion before an ambush. For the next 2d6 rounds,
the behtus gain a +4 bonus to their Strength and Constitution
scores and quadruple their base speed (including their climb
speed). Behtus also take a -4 penalty to their Intelligence and
Wisdom scores for the duration of the infusion. A non-behtu
character who ingests a behtu infusion becomes poisoned and
takes 10 (3d6) poison damage; a successful DC 14 Constitution
saving throw against poison reduces damage to half and
negates the poisoned condition.
