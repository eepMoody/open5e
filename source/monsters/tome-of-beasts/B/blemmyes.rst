Blemmyes
--------

*This headless giant has a large mouth in its chest, with eyes bulging
out on either side of it.*

**Always Hungry.** Blemmyes are brutes that savor humanoid
flesh, and they see all humanoids as potential meals. Some even
have the patience to tend groups of humans, goblins, or halflings
like unruly herds, farming them for food and fattening them up
for maximum succulence.

**Cannibals.** So great is their hideous hunger that blemmyes
are not above eating their own kind; they cull and consume the
weakest specimens of their race when other food is scarce. The
most terrible habit of these monsters is that they seldom wait
for their food to die, or even for a battle to conclude, before
launching into a grisly feast.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack:** The blemmyes
makes two slam attacks and
one bite attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8
to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19
(4d6 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a
Medium or smaller incapacitated creature, that
creature is swallowed. While swallowed, the
creature is blinded and restrained, it has total
cover against attacks and other effects from
outside the blemmyes, and it takes 14 (4d6)
acid damage at the start of each of the blemmyesâ€™ turns. If the
blemmyes takes 20 damage or more during a single turn from
a creature inside it, the blemmyes must succeed on a DC 16
Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate
the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within
5 feet of the blemmyes. The blemmyes can have only one
target swallowed at a time. If the blemmyes dies, a swallowed
creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the
corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a
creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or
be stunned until the end of its next turn.

**Rock.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 27 (4d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is
a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw
or be frightened until the end of its next turn.
