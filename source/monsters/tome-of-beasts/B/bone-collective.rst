Bone Collective
---------------

*A bone collective is almost a fluid; its thousands of tiny bones
coalesce into a humanoid form only to disperse in a clattering
swarm the next moment. Their tiny bones rustle when they move, a
quiet sound similar to sand sliding down a dune.*

**Spies and Sneaks.** Bone collectives are not primarily fighters,
although they swarm well enough. They prefer to spy and skulk.
When cornered, however, they fight without fear or hesitation,
seeking to strip the flesh from their foes.

**Zombie Mounts.** Bone collectives’ long finger bones and
hooked claws help them climb onto zombie mounts and control
them. Bone collectives almost always wear robes or cloaks, the
better to pretend to be humanoid. They understand that most
creatures find their nature disturbing.

**Feed on Society.** Bone collectives join the societies around
them, whether human, goblin, or ghoul. They prey on the living
and the dead, using them to replenish lost bones. Occasionally,
they choose to serve necromancers, darakhul, some vampires,
and liches, all of whom offers magical attunements and vile joys
to the collective.

They dislike extreme heat, as it makes their bones brittle.

**Hive Mind.** All elements of a bone collective within 50 miles
of their main body constantly communicate with each other.
If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. Any bone
collective with at least 30 hit points forms a hive mind, giving
it an Intelligence of 14. Below this hp threshold, it becomes
mindless (Intelligence 0) and loses its innate spellcasting
ability. At 0 hp, a few surviving sets of bones scatter, and must
spend months to create a new collective.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The bone collective’s innate spellcasting
ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell
attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no
material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:chill-touch`

**3/day:** :ref:`srd:animate-dead` (up to 5 skeletons or zombies)

**Swarm.** A bone collective can act as a swarm (composed of
smaller elements), or it can grant a single member (called
an exarch) control, acting as a singular creature. Changing
between forms takes one action. In its singular form, the
collective can’t occupy the same space as another creature, but
it can perform sneak attacks and cast spells. In swarm form,
the bone collective can occupy another creature’s space and
vice versa, and it can move through openings at least 1 foot
square. It can’t change to singular form while it occupies the
same space as another creature. It uses its skills normally in
either form.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The bone collective makes two claw attacks, or
one claw and one bite attack, or one swarm attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
31 (4d12 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC
16 Constitution save or suffer the effects of Wyrmblood Venom.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 25 (3d12 + 5) slashing damage.

**Swarm.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 0 ft., one
creature in the swarm’s space. *Hit:* 57 (8d12 + 5) piercing
damage, or 31 (4d12 + 5) piercing damage if the bone
collective has half its hit points or fewer. If the attack hits, the
target must make a successful DC 15 Constitution save or
suffer the effects of Wyrmblood Venom.

**Wyrmblood Venom (Injury).** Bone collectives create a reddish
liquid, which they smear on their fangs. The freakish red
mouths on the tiny skeletons are
disturbing, and the toxin is deadly.
A bitten creature must succeed
on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw or become :ref:`srd:poisoned` and
take 1d6 Charisma damage. A
poisoned creature repeats the
saving throw every four hours,
taking another 1d6 Charisma
damage for each failure,
until it has made two
consecutive successful
saves or survived for 24
hours. If the creature
survives, the effect
ends and the creature
can heal normally.
Lost Charisma can be
regained with a :ref:`srd:lesser-restoration` spell or
comparable magic.
