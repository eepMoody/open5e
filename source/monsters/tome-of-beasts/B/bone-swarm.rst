Bone Swarm
----------

*Dank winds sweep up skeletons, both humanoid and animal. They
blow forward, reaching out for living creatures like a clawed hand
of bone. A scattering of bones rolls across the ground, then rises into
the air, billowing like a sheet.*

**Swarms of Fallen.** On rare
occasions, the pugnacious
spirits of fallen undead
join together, bonded
by a common craving:
to feel alive again. They
gather up their bones from
life, as well as any
other bones they
come across, and
form bone swarms.

**Nomadic Undead.** These
swarms then ravage the
countryside wresting life from
living creatures, grabbing
livestock, humanoids, and
even dragons, digging in their claws in an attempt to cling to life.
Bone swarms with one or more sets of jaws wail constantly in
their sorrow, interrupting their cries with snippets of rational
but scattered speech declaiming their woes and despair.

**Cliff and Pit Dwellers.** Bone swarms gather near cliffs,
crevasses, and pits in the hope of forcing a victim or an entire
herd of animals to fall to its death, creating more shattered
bones to add to their mass.

**Undead Nature.** A mask wight doesn’t require
air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Strength of Bone.** A bone swarm can choose to deal
bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, and adds 1.5× its
Strength bonus on swarm damage rolls as bits and pieces of
broken skeletons claw, bite, stab, and slam at the victim.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and
vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening
large enough for a human skull. The swarm can’t regain hit
points or gain temporary hit points.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The bone swarm can attack every hostile creature
in its space with swirling bones.

**Swirling Bones.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach
0 ft., one creature in the swarm’s space. *Hit:* 31 (5d8 + 9)
bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (includes Strength
of Bone special ability).

**Death’s Embrace (Recharge 5-6).** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10
to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. *Hit:* the
target is grappled (escape DC 16) and enveloped within the
swarm's bones. While the creature is grappled, the swarm can
direct the creature's movement on the creature's turn, or at
any other time the creature would be allowed to move. Any
non-area attack against the bone swarm has a 50% chance of
hitting a creature grappled in Death's Embrace instead.
