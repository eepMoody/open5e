Bone Crab
---------

*A bone crab’s cracked skull scurries forward on bone-white legs.
These tainted crustaceans make discarded craniums their home.*

**Skull Shells.** Much like an enormous hermit crab, bone
crabs inhabit the remains of large fish, humanoids, and other
creatures. A bone crab’s spiny, ivory-white legs blend in perfectly
with bones and pale driftwood. When lacking bones, these crabs
gnaw cavities into chunks of driftwood or coral to make a shelter,
cementing bits of shell and debris to their portable homes. All
crabs fight over choice skulls.

**Scavengers of Memory.** Bone crabs are voracious
scavengers. They live in seaside crags and coves, where they
use their specialized chelae to crack open skulls and feast on
the brains. Centuries of such feeding have given bone crabs a
collective intelligence. Some crabs retain fragments of memory
from those they devour, and these crabs recognize friends or
attack the foes of those whose skulls they wear.

Bone crabs hunt in packs, preying on seabirds and creatures
stranded in tidal pools. They drag aquatic prey above the high
tide line and leave it to fester in the hot sun. They pick corpses
clean in a few hours, so their hunting grounds are littered with
cracked and sun-bleached bones—the perfect hiding place for
these littoral predators.

**White Ghost Shivers.** Because they eat carrion, bone crabs
carry a dangerous disease—white ghost shivers, which wrack
victims with fever and delirium. Sailors and others who eat a
bone crab’s unwholesome, diseased flesh rarely survive it.
Although bone crabs cannot be domesticated, they can be
convinced to nest in particular areas, attacking intruders while
ignoring the area’s regulars.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The bone crab makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage.

**White Ghost Shivers.** A living creature that is injured by or
makes physical contact with a creature carrying the white
ghost shivers must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving
throw at the end of the encounter to avoid becoming infected.
This disease manifests after 24 hours, beginning as a mild chill,
but increasingly severe after a day, accompanied by a fever.
Hallucinations are common, and the fright they induce lends
the disease its name. At onset, the infected creature gains two
levels of exhaustion that cannot be removed until the disease
is cured by lesser restoration, comparable magic, or rest. The
infected creature makes another DC 11 Constitution saving
throw at the end of each long rest; a successful save removes
one level of exhaustion. If the saving throw fails, the disease
persists. If both levels of exhaustion are removed by successful
saving throws, the victim has recovered naturally.
