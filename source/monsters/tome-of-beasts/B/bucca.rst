Bucca
-----

*These tiny, obsidian-skinned, bat-winged fey always
have a hungry look, leering with razor-sharp fangs
showing and licking their leathery faces with
their forked, purple tongues.*

**Hidden in Crevices.** Buccas are tiny,
underground faeries who are also
known as “snatchers,” because they
love to steal from miners and hoard
precious minerals and gems in tiny,
trap‑filled crevices. Their small
size makes them easy to overlook.

**Treasure Finders.** Buccas
are often enslaved by derro as
treasure seekers and can be
summoned by some derro
shamans. Buccas are the
bane of the dwarves of
many mountains and hilly
cantons, serving as spies and
scouts for evil humanoids.

**Bat Friends.** Buccas often
train :ref:`bats <srd:bat>` as mounts, messengers, and guard animals. On
occasion they sell them to goblins and kobolds.
