Boloti
------

*This small, leering water spirit resembles a cross between a gray
frog and a damp scarecrow, with small tendrils sprouting from all
its extremities. It has water wings seemingly made out of jellyfish
flesh, allowing it to jet through the water at high speeds.*

**Swamp Robbers.** Known as “uriska” in Draconic, the bolotis
are small, swamp-dwelling water spirits which delight in
drowning unsuspecting victims in shallow pools and springs,
then robbing their corpses of whatever shiny objects they find.
Bolotis use their magical vortex to immobilize their victims and
drag them to a watery death. They delight in storing up larders of
victims under winter ice or under logs.

**Fond of Allies.** Bolotis sometimes team up with vodyanoi,
miremals, and will-o’-wisps to create cunning ambushes. They
are happy with a single kill at a time.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Dagger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range
20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage.

**Vortex (1/Day).** A boloti can transform into a vortex of swirling,
churning water for up to 4 minutes. This ability can be used
only while the boloti is underwater, and the boloti can’t leave
the water while in vortex form. While in vortex form, the boloti
can enter another creature’s space and stop there in vortex
form. In this liquid form, the boloti still takes normal damage
from weapons and magic.

A creature in the same space as the boloti at the start of
the creature’s turn takes 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage unless
it makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. If the
creature is Medium or smaller, a failed saving throw also means
it is grappled (escape DC 11). Until this grapple ends, the
target is restrained and unable to breathe unless it can breathe
water. If the saving throw succeeds, the target is pushed 5 feet
so it is out of the boloti’s space.
