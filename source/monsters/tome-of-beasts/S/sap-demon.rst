Sap Demon
---------

*When a sap demon leaves a tree, its milky amber fluid oozes from
an axe wound on a stout maple’s trunk and shapes itself into
a small, vaguely humanoid form on the forest floor beside the
tree. This languid creature half walks and half flows forward,
implacably following the axe wielder’s path to certain revenge.*

**Tree Oozes.** Sap demons aren’t true demons, but rather are
intelligent oozes that form when an enchanted tree is cut or
injured. Though typically Small, the larger the sap source is,
the larger the resulting creature can be. Over a few hours, they
pool into a shape that vaguely resembles their tree’s attacker:
for instance, if the tree cutter wore a hat, then a hat may be
incorporated into the sap demon’s overall shape. The similarity
is faint at best; no one would ever confuse a sap demon for the
creature it hunts, because its shape has no sharp features or color
other than amber.

**Called to Vengeance.** Sap demons can pummel their prey
with partially-crystallized fists, but they especially enjoy claiming
the weapon that wounded their tree and wielding it to deliver a
final blow. Once their prey is destroyed, most sap demons return
to their tree, but not all do. Some are curious or malevolent
enough to explore the world further.

**Reckless Possessors.** A sap demon can possess another
creature by grappling it and oozing down its throat. Once inside,
the sap demon dominates its host and makes it bleed as the tree
bled. Since the sap demon takes no damage when its host is
wounded, it’s free to be as reckless as it likes. It might wander
into a town to cause trouble. However, no matter how its new
body is bandaged or cured, it never stops bleeding slowly. If the
host body is killed, the sap demon oozes out during the next
hour and either returns to its tree or seeks another host.

**Season’s Change.** If a sap demon (or its host) takes at least 10

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The sap demon makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (2d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage. If both attacks hit a
Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC
12), and the sap demon uses Soul Sap on it as a bonus action.

**Soul Sap.** The sap demon slides down the throat of a sleeping,
helpless, or grappled living creature of Medium size or
smaller. Once inside, the sap demon takes control of its host,
as per the dominate monster spell (Wisdom DC 12 negates).
While dominated, the host gains blindsight 90 feet. The host
drips blood from its ears, nose, eyes, or from a wound that
resembles the injury done to the sap demon’s tree (1 damage/
hour). Damage inflicted on the host has no effect on the sap
demon. If the host dies or is reduced to 0 hit points, the sap
demon must leave the body within one hour.
