Sharkjaw Skeleton
-----------------

*The humanoid form approaches through the murky
water, but as it nears, it becomes clear that this is
no living thing. It is made entirely of sharks’ jaws,
joined together and brought to life with grim magic.*

Made from numerous, interlocking shark’s jaws,
these horrors are animated through foul magic into
a large, vaguely humanoid shape. Sahuagin priests
animate them to guard their sepulchers of bones.
These sharkjaw skeletons lie among great piles of
bones, waiting to rise up and attack any uninvited souls
who invade the sanctity of sahuagin holy sites. Others
guard pirate treasures or
ancient shipwrecks.

**Undead Automaton.**
Being mindless, sharkjaw
skeletons do nothing
without orders from their
creator, and they follow those
instructions explicitly. A sharkjaw
skeleton’s creator can give it new
commands as long as the skeleton
is within 60 feet and can see and
hear its creator. Otherwise, a
sharkjaw skeleton follows its last
instructions to the best of its ability and
to the exclusion of all else, though it will
always fight back if attacked.
