Slow Storm
----------

*Wisps of humid wind revolve around this spiny ball. Two massive
black eyes and a dark mouth are the only features visible through
its static straight quills.*

**Chaos Aging.** Despite its comical appearance, a slow storm is
a creature of chaos, able to visit the pains of old age on the young
and fit. It turns the bodies of physically able creatures against
them, forcing them to choose between relative inactivity or
ever‑increasing pain.

**Surrounded by Wind.** A slow storm is a smaller creature
than the space it occupies, and its vulnerable physical body
is protected by a cyclonic wind surrounding it. The slow
storm occupies a space 15 feet square, but its physical body
occupies just the center 5-foot space. The nucleus of a slow
storm is a two-foot radius sphere weighing 75 lb. The rest
of the space is “occupied” by protective, high-speed wind.
Only the central, physical body is susceptible to damage;
the wind is just wind. Enemies using melee weapons with
less than 10-foot reach must step into the whirlwind to
attack the slow storm.

**Static Generator.** A slow storm has no internal organs
other than its brain, and it lives on the energy and moisture it
drains from opponents. Its quills not only deflect debris but also
generate a ball of static electricity that delivers a shock attack.

**Elemental Nature.** A slow storm doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

**Bone Wrack.** When hit by the slow storm’s slam or breath
weapon attack, the storm absorbs moisture from the living
creatures’ joints, causing stiffness and pain. In addition to 1d4
Dexterity drain, any creature caught within the slow storm’s
breath weapon that fails another DC 18 Constitution save
suffers crushing pain in bones and joints. Any round in which
the pained creature moves, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage
per 5 feet moved. Bone wracking pain lasts until the affected
creature regains at least 1 point of lost Dexterity.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The slow storm’s innate spellcasting ability
is Wisdom (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** lightning bolt

**3/day:** chain lightning

**Storm Form.** A creature that enters or starts its turn inside
the slow storm’s whirlwind takes 9 (2d8) force damage. A
creature can take this damage just once per round. In addition,
ranged missile weapon attacks against the slow storm have
disadvantage because of the high-speed wind.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 31 (4d12 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) piercing
damage.

**Static Shock (Recharge 5-6).** The slow storm exhales its
electrical power in a 30-foot cone. Targets in the area of effect
take 54 (12d8) lightning damage 1d4 Dexterity loss, and suffer
bone wrack. A successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw
halves the Dexterity loss and prevents the bone wrack.
