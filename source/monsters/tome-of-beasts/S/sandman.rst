Sandman
-------

*Stick-thin and moon-faced with a raptor’s eyes and a mane of
hawk feathers, this grinning humanoid pirouettes as nimbly as a
dancer. Between its long, taloned fingers trickles sand that gleams
with the cold light of stars.*

**Bringers of Nightmares.** Sandmen are sinister-looking
bringers of sleep and dreams. Visiting the mortal world each
night, sandmen ensure that their targets slumber deeply and
experience vivid dreams that swell the dream realm’s power.
Some sandmen develop a talent for a specific flavor of
dream; fantasies of lost love or childhood, prophecies
and religious visions, or terrible nightmares.

**Abduct Dreamers.** Powerful dreamers attract
both the attention and the protection of sandmen:
children, madmen, would-be tyrants, and heroes.
They protect such charges fiercely but have also
been known to abduct them, taking them on wild
adventures to inspire yet greater dreams. To them, all
dreams are vital and good, be they uplifting or terrifying.
Although they bring horrific nightmares as well as idyllic
dreams, sandmen are not specifically baneful. Their actions
are motivated by their connection to the dream realm, not by
concerns over good and evil.

**Ethereal Dreamscapes.** When not on the Material Plane,
sandmen ride bubble-like dreamscapes through the Ethereal
Plane, breaching the Sea of Possibilities, nurturing and
harvesting its contents. Sandmen are a common and welcome
sight in markets across the Fey Realms, elemental planes,
and even in Hell—anywhere that dreams or nightmares are a
valuable commodity. They are merciless to any who threaten the
sanctity of dreams, but especially dream eaters.

**Eye-Closer’s Curse.** If a sandman obtains a critical hit or
successful surprise attack against an opponent, its talons
scratch a rune onto the target’s eyeballs that snaps their
eyelids shut, leaving them
blinded. This effect can
be ended with greater
restoration, remove curse,
or comparable magic.

**Innate Spellcasting.**
The sandman’s innate
spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC
15). It can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no
material components:

**At will:** darkness, minor

**Stuff of Dreams.** Made partially from dreams and imagination,
a sandman takes only half damage from critical hits and from
sneak attacks. All of the attack’s damage is halved, not just
bonus damage.

**Surprise Attack.** If the sandman hits a surprised creature
during the first round of combat, the target takes 14 (4d6)
extra damage from the attack.
