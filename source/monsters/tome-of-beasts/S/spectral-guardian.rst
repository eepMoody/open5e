Spectral Guardian
-----------------

*A luminous green mist swirls into the form of an ancient warrior.
Dented armor and a ragged cloak enshroud the warrior’s skeletal
body, and its grinning skull leers out from an open helm.*

**Worn Finery.** Composed of faintly glowing green vapor, the
spectral guardian is a skeletal being encased in ancient armor
or noble’s finery. The cloth is worn and tattered, spiraling away
into mist at the edges, and the creature glides with the faintest
whisper of sound like a mournful moan from far away.

**Eternal Disgrace.** The spectral guardian is the spirit of an
ancient warrior or noble, bound to serve in death as it failed to do
in life. A broken oath, an act of cowardice, or a curse laid down by
the gods for a terrible betrayal leaves an indelible mark on a soul.
After the cursed creature’s death, its spirit rises, unquiet, in a
place closely related to its disgrace. Compelled by the crushing
weight of its deeds, the spectral guardian knows no rest or peace,
and viciously snuffs out all life that intrudes upon its haunt.
Undead Nature. A spectral guardian doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a
long rest.

creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or
be frightened and have its speed reduced to 0; both effects
last until the end of its next turn.
