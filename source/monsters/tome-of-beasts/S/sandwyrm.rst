Sandwyrm
--------

*While they mimic the bleached bones of a desert creature, the
bony adornments atop along their backs are part of their peculiar
melding of bone and scale.*

**Hidden by Sand.** These lethargic, horned, yellow-scaled
lizards spend most of their lives underground, lying in wait
under the desert sand with their long-necked, spine-tailed bulk
hidden below the surface and only the long, jagged bones lining
their backs exposed. These bones resemble a sun-bleached
ribcage so perfectly that it attracts carrion birds—and curious
travelers. When prey passes between the “ribs,” the sandwyrm
snaps the rows of bone tightly over its prey. Once its victim is
restrained, the sandwyrm paralyzes its meal with repeated stings
before carrying it away.

**Torpid and Slow.** Sandwyrms sometimes wait for weeks in
torpid hibernation before footsteps on the sand alert it to a fresh
meal approaching. To guard against lean weeks, sandwyrms
store excess prey in subterranean lairs. They’re not above eating
carrion if fresh meat isn’t available. When outmatched in a fight,
sandwyrms retreat to their lairs with their paralyzed prety.

**Peculiar Drakes.** Sandwyrms evolved as an offshoot
to drakes or wyverns rather than from true dragons; their
anatomy suggests they were originally four-limbed creatures
and that their forearms are recent additions to the animal’s
body. The bones on their backs may have once been wings, so
that sandwyrms are the remnants of some primordial, winged
reptiles that migrated to the deep deserts.

**Spine Trap.** When underground with its spines exposed,
the sandwyrm can snap its spines closed on one Large, two
Medium, or four Small or Tiny creatures above it. Each creature
must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be
:ref:`srd:restrained`. A restrained creature can use its action to make
a DC 15 Strength check to free itself or another restrained
creature, ending the effect on a success. Creatures restrained
by this trait move with the sandwyrm. The sandwyrm’s stinger
attack has advantage against creatures restrained by this trait.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The sandwyrm makes one bite attack and one
stinger attack. It can gore in place of the bite attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.

**Gore.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (1d12 + 5) piercing damage.

**Stinger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
creature. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 24 (7d6)
poison damage, or half as much poison damage with a
successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the poison
damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable
but :ref:`srd:poisoned` and :ref:`srd:paralyzed` for 1 hour. Regaining hit points
doesn’t end the poisoning or paralysis.
