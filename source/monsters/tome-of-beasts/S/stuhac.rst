Stuhac
------

*This pale-skinned, white-bearded hermit wears a winter cloak and
travels the mountain paths, cliff sides, and trade routes alone.*

**Feigns Weakness.** Living in isolated mountain passes and
foraging along little-traveled slopes, the stuhac is a master of
stealth and deception. Wrapping heavy furs around itself, it poses
as a feeble hermit or traveler needing assistance. Only after its
victims have been lured away from warmth and safety does the
stuhac drop its disguise and show its true nature: the withered
traveler's gnarled hands uncurl to reveal jagged yellow claws,
its cataract-ridden eyes are exposed as waxen orbs wobbling
loosely in their sockets; throwing open its cloak, it proudly
shows off woven layers of yellowed tendon and ligament.

**Hideous Garments.** The stuhac’s most prized
possessions are its “clutters,” garments woven
of layered and tangled ligaments and tendons.
These grisly trophies are taken from scores of
victims, and stuhacs treasure each bit of their
disgusting attire. When two stuhac meet, they
compare their garb, swapping anecdotes of their most horrifying
kills and deceptions.

Stuhacs weave new ligaments into their clutters while their
still-living victims watch. Lying in crippled agony, they cannot
flee as the stuhac tears fresh material from their bodies for its
garments. To keep screams from disturbing their work, these
monsters sever their victim’s vocal chords.

**Devour Victims.** Once its clutters are done, the stuhac feeds
on its live victim, devouring everything but the bones. Finding
a clean-picked humanoid skeleton along a mountain path is a
reliable sign of a stuhac’s presence.
Because female stuhacs have never been reported, some
believe that these fiends mate with demons, hags, or lamias.
Others believe stuhacs are part of a hideous malediction, a recipe
for immortality that requires the subject to devour its own kind.

**Mountain Stride.**
Mountain slopes and
stone outcroppings
pose no obstacle to
a stuhac’s movement. In mountainous areas, it scrambles
through difficult terrain without hindrance.

**Powerful Leap.** The stuhac can jump three times the normal
distance: 66 feet horizontally or 27 feet vertically with a
running start, or half those distances from a stationary start.

**Shapechanger.** The stuhac can use its action to polymorph
into one of two forms: that of an elderly humanoid male, and
its natural form. It cannot alter either form’s appearance or
capabilities using this ability, and damage sustained in one
form transfers to the other form.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The stuhac makes two claw attacks and one bite
attack, or two claw attacks and one hobble.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 20 (4d6 + 6) piercing damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 29 (5d8 + 6) slashing damage.

**Hobble.** A stuhac can cripple a creature by telekinetically
tearing its tendons and ligaments. A stuhac can target one
creature within 100 feet. The target must make a successful
DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 13 (3d8) force
damage and its speed is reduced by 20 feet. Magical
movement (flight, teleportation, etc.) is unaffected. This
damage can only be cured through magical healing, not by
spending hit dice or resting.
