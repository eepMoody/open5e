Scheznyki
---------

*These small, vicious fey look like dirty, lazy dwarves dressed in
burlap pants and shirts tied on with dirty twine and frayed rope.
They are usually bootless with broken, dirty toenails and wearing
rough burlap and leather tams as hats.*

**Corrupted Dwarves.** Nicknamed “vanishers,” these small,
vicious, dwarf-like fey haunt abandoned quarries and ancient
ruins, killing and robbing unsuspecting visitors. Legend says the
scheznykis are lazy dwarves corrupted by the shadow fey, though
others claim that these are dwarves who swore allegiance to fey
lords and ladies long ago. They live in drowned and abandoned
mines, tumbledown ruins, and even in the tomb complexes of
long‑departed priests and god-kings.

**Magical Hats.** Their shadow fey masters have given them
magical hats that allow them to fly and become invisible at will.
These hats can be stolen and used by adventurers (see sidebar),
but the scheznykis fight hard to retrieve them.

   The sidebars in Tome of Beasts are not Open Game Content, so we can't
   include the details of Vanisher Hats here.

   Feel free to make up your own magical hat with the same name!

**Arcane Beards.** If an adventurer can successfully grapple a
scheznyki, they can attempt to cut the creature’s beard with a
magical blade (the beard is AC 15 and has 5 hp). When an attacker
successfully cuts off the beard, the scheznyki loses access to all
spell-like and spell casting abilities—and the beard hair itself is
valuable in making potion inks.

If the scheznyki loses its hat and beard at the same time, it
falls into a deep, wasting coma and dies in 24 hours or when
next exposed to sunlight. When this occurs, the scheznyki’s
body crumbles into dust and blows away one round later. If its
beard is magically mended or regrown, or its hat restored to
its head before this happens, the scheznyki recovers fully and
immediately.
