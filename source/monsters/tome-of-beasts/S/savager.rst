Savager
-------

*A porcupine-quilled creature built like a grizzly bear with claws
and fangs like scimitars. A savager’s forelegs are mangled and
scabbed, and its eyes shine with hatred and anticipation.*

**Driven by Dark Spirits.** While druids
claim these bear-like animals are not
cursed or enchanted, the savager’s habit of
killing any living creature on sight is not
natural behavior. Hunger doesn’t explain
their attacks, since savagers eat only part of
their kills before abandoning the meal and
looking for other animals to attack. Some
dark forest spirit drives them.

**Gnaws Itself.** When there are no other
creatures nearby to attack, a savager gnaws
on its own forelimbs, resulting in scabs,
scars, and calluses so thick and numb that
they protect the savager from even the
sharpest of swords.

**Rare Meetings.** The only creature a
savager won’t attack on sight is another
savager. If they are of the same sex,
the two avoid each out of self-preservation, and if they’re of
the opposite sex, they mate so
ferociously that both creatures
are left wounded, angry, and
hungry. A savager litter contains
anywhere from 10 to 25 cubs, all of
them born able to walk and fend
for themselves. This is important,
because within 24 hours after giving
birth, a savager mother no longer
recognizes her own offspring, and she
will attack and cannibalize any that don’t
escape on their own.

A savager weighs 1,800 pounds and is 11
feet long.
