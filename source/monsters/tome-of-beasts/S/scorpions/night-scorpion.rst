Night Scorpion
--------------

*These midnight-black scorpions have a bright-red stripe on their
tails, signaling the crippling poison within.*

**Blinding Poison.** This aptly named arachnid hunter blinds
victims with a dose of its crippling poison. It feeds on whole
camels when given the chance, but it more commonly devours
goats, sheep, and people. It hunts by night, when its blindvision
is most effective.

**Underdark Giants.** The species is common in deep caves and
underworld realms. They are eight feet long with a seven-foot
tail and daggerlike stinger. They weigh up to 200 pounds.

**Valuable Venom.** Night scorpion venom is highly prized and
can command upwards of 400 gp per dose.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The scorpion makes three attacks: two with its
claws and one with its sting.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 6 (1d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and the target is
:ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 12). The scorpion has two claws, each of
which can grapple one target.

**Sting.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage, and the target takes 7 (2d6)
poison damage and is :ref:`srd:blinded` for 1d3 hours; a successful DC
12 Constitution saving throw reduces damage by half and
prevents blindness. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or
more, the target is also :ref:`srd:paralyzed` while poisoned. The poisoned
target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.
