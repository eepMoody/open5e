Stygian Fat-Tailed Scorpion
---------------------------

*The black carapace gleams in the desert sun, and its tail
drips translucent venom. Even the largest lion avoids
this scorpion.*

**Highly Venomous.** Known for its small size and
aggressive behavior, the Stygian fat-tailed scorpion brings
a swift death to those who feel its toxic sting.

**Pit Traps.** A Stygian fat-tailed scorpion is no more than a
foot long, with a tail about the same length. It weighs no more
than 5 pounds for the largest specimens—they make excellent
guard animals that require little food or care, and are often kept
at the bottom of pits or in rarely used tunnels.

**Valuable Venom.** A dose of fat-tailed scorpion venom can be
worth 4,000 gp or more to the right buyer.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The scorpion makes three attacks: two with its
claws and one with its sting.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 1 bludgeoning damage.

**Sting.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 1 piercing damage, plus 21 (6d6) poison damage and the
target is :ref:`srd:poisoned` until it completes a short or long rest. A
successful DC 10 Constitution saving
throw reduces the poison
damage to half and
prevents the poisoned
condition. If the target
fails this saving throw
while already poisoned,
it gains one level of
:ref:`srd:exhaustion` in addition to
the other effects.
