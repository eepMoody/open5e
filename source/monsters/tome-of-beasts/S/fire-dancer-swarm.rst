Swarm, Fire Dancers
-------------------

*A swirling mass of tiny, blue flames dances with the likeness of a
skull embedded in each little, flickering fire.*

**Stunted Elementals.** Fire dancers are Tiny fire elementals.
Speculation varies whether they’re simply immature or
somehow stunted. They may be castoffs from larger, fiery
elemental beings. A single, solitary fire dancer is no more than
a semi-sentient spark with a fragment of life and lofty but
unrealistic ambitions. In large numbers, they’re a menace.

**Unite and Grow Strong.** Larger fire elementals are usually
sessile creatures, content merely to exist on their plane of origin.
Fire dancers possess (and some argue are infected with) mortal
qualities—they seek to reach a greater potential, which smacks
of envy, ambition, and resentment. They realize that there is
power in numbers and that, when united, they are a force to be
reckoned with. A single fire dancer is no more threatening than a
tiny candle flame, burning hot and blue. When thousands of join
together, though, the result is an inferno. The likeness of a skull
in its flame is an illusion created by the creature, based on how
the fire dancers perceive mortal creatures after they’re done
with them.

**Surly Servants.** Lone fire dancers have individuality, but in
groups, they develop a hive mentality. While this allows them to
function as a swarm, it also makes them vulnerable as a group to
mind-affecting magic. Savvy bards, conjurers, and enchanters
who summon swarms of fire dancers know they must maintain a
tight control on the swarm, for these creatures are surly servants
at the best of times.

**Elemental Nature.** A swarm of fire dancers doesn’t require
air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Fire Form.** A creature that touches the swarm or hits it with a
melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage.
In addition, the first time the swarm enters a creature’s space
on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and catches
fire; until someone uses an action to douse the fire, the creature
takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Illumination.** The swarm sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius
and dim light to an additional 30 feet.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and
vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening
large enough for a Tiny creature. The swarm can’t regain hit
points or gain temporary hit points.

**Water Susceptibility.** For every 5 feet the swarm moves in
water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1
cold damage.
