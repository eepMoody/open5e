Sathaq Worm
-----------

*This titanic worm’s rocky hide is rough and hard as stone. Its
yawning gullet writhes with miniature worms like itself.*

**Elemental Predators.** Sathaq worms are nightmarish
predators from the Plane of Elemental Earth, 30 feet long and
10 feet thick, with rugged brown hide embedded with stones.
They devour stone and flesh with equal ease.

**Guts Filled with Larvae.** Sathaq worms are solitary; they
approach each other only to mate. Their young incubate inside
the worms’ gullets. Creatures they swallow are simultaneously
digested by the parent worm and devoured by the larvae.

**Painful Presence.** Ultrasonic noise and magical ripples that
tear at flesh and bone make the very presence of a sathaq worm
extremely uncomfortable for creatures of the Material Plane.

**Agonizing Aura.** The sathaq worms’ presence induces pain
in creatures native to the Material
Plane. Any creature that starts its
turn within 30 feet of the sathaq
worm must make a DC 17 Fortitude
saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature is poisoned until the start
of its next turn. If a creature’s saving
throw succeeds, it is immune to the
sathaq worm’s Agonizing Aura for
the next 24 hours.

**Earth Glide.** The sathaq worm can
burrow through nonmagical, unworked
earth and stone. While doing so, the
elemental doesn’t disturb the material it
moves through.

**Siege Monster.** The sathaq worm deals
double damage to objects and structures.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 24 (4d8 + 6) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or
smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving
throw or be swallowed by the sathaq worm. A swallowed
creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against
attacks and other effects outside the worm, and takes 7 (2d6)
bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) slashing damage plus 7
(2d6) acid damage at the start of each of the sathaq worm’s
turns. The sathaq worm can have only one creature swallowed
at a time. If the sathaq worm takes 20 damage or more on a
single turn from a creature inside it, the sathaq worm must
succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of
that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls
prone in a space within 5 feet of the sathaq worm. If the sathaq
worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it
and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement,
exiting prone.
