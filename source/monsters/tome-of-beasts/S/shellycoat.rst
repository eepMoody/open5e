Shellycoat
----------

*Despite being short and squat, this creature’s relationship with a
troll is undeniable. The kinship is most notable in the long arms
and thick, pebbly hide.*

**Long Handed and Toad-like.** The shellycoat is a warped and
spiteful creature also called the Iamh fada, or “long hands,” and
they are frequently referred to as bridge trolls. Despite being fey,
they are distantly related to true trolls. Unlike those tall, lanky
creatures, a shellycoat is dwarfish and toad-like, with short, bent,
legs and freakishly long arms with swollen, distended joints. It
can further dislocate and stretch these joints to alarming lengths.

**Bridges and Pools.** The shellycoat can be found in abandoned
wells or behind waterfalls, in deep tide pools, or beneath the ice
of frozen ponds, but their preferred haunt has always been under
bridges. They are most active during nighttime and on heavily
overcast days, because of their mortal dread of sunlight.

A shellycoat's favored tactic is to lie in wait under the water or
ice (or bridge) and surprise its prey. It strikes outward or upward
from its hiding place to snatch children, livestock (preferably
goats), and lone travelers or fishermen. Prey is dragged down to
the shadows and water to be robbed and devoured.

**Shining Garments.** A shellycoat will always have fashioned
for itself a coat, cloak, or shirt of colored pebbles, glass, and
polished river shells. These adornments are crude but beautiful
and sometimes magical.
