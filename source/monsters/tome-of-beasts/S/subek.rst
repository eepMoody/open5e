Subek
-----

*For most of the year the subek are a kindly race, advising others
and lending their physical and intellectual prowess to local
projects. During the flood season, however, subek become violent
and territorial, ruthlessly killing and consuming all trespassers.*

**Riverbank Homes.** Subek are crocodile-headed humanoids
that dwell along the banks of great rivers. They are tailless,
possessing muscular physiques, surprisingly dexterous hands,
and a frightening maw of sharp teeth. They are 9 feet tall,
average 700 lb., and can live up to 300 years.
During the dry season, subek are friendly, thoughtful scholars,
historians, and artisans.

**Flood Fever.** Subek are well aware of their destructive and
violent nature. When the waters rise, they distance themselves
from other cultures, warning locals to keep away until the river
recedes. Most migrate up or down river to an area with few
inhabitants; some even construct underground prisons or cages
and pay brave retainers to keep them locked up and fed during
their time of savagery.

During flood fever, subek do not recognize friends or
colleagues. They discard all trappings of civilization and kill non-subek
creatures indiscriminately. Once the fever clears, they
remember nothing of their actions, though they are surrounded
by undeniable, grisly reminders.

**Keep Their Distance.** Despite the danger, subek are
tolerated and even prized for their skill as engineers, historians,
and teachers. They live on the outskirts of many human towns,
maintaining a cautious distance from their neighbors. Subek
marriage is pragmatic; they live with a mate long enough to
foster a single egg and raise the hatchling for a decade before
parting ways.

Subek scholars and oracles debate their duality. Some believe it
to be an ancient curse, a shared ancestry with northern trolls,
or some loathsome and primitive part of their soul
exerting control. A rare few—shamans and
oracles, mostly—embrace their duality and
choose to live year-round in remote regions far
from civilization.
