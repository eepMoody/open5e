Shoggoth
--------

*A shoggoth is an intelligent, gelatinous blob that can reshape itself
at will. Created by an elder race as servants, the shoggoths rebelled
long ago and slew their masters without pity. Since that time,
they’ve lived in isolated or desolate regions, devouring whatever
they encounter and absorbing its flesh into their own amorphous,
shifting forms.*

**Constant Growth.** When in a spherical form, a shoggoth’s
mass is enough to have a 10- to 15-foot diameter, though this is
just an average size. Shoggoths continue growing throughout
their lives, though the eldest among them grow very slowly
indeed, and some shoggoths may shrink from starvation if they
deplete a territory of resources.

**Mutable Form.** A shoggoth can form eyes, mouths, tentacles,
and other appendages as needed, though it lacks the control to
truly polymorph into another creature’s shape and hold it.

**Anaerobic.** A shoggoth doesn’t need oxygen to live. It can
exist with equal comfort at the bottom of the ocean or in the
vacuum of outer space.

**Absorb Flesh.** The body of a creature that dies while grappled
by a shoggoth is completely absorbed into the shoggoth’s
mass. No portion of it remains to be used in raise dead,
reincarnate, and comparable spells that require touching the
dead person’s body.

**Amorphous.** A shoggoth can move through a space as small as
1 foot wide. It must spend 1 extra foot of movement for every
foot it moves through a space smaller than itself, but it isn’t
subject to any other penalties for squeezing.

**Hideous Piping.** The fluting noises made by a shoggoth are
otherworldly and mind-shattering. A creature that can hear
this cacophony at the start of its turn and is within 120 feet of
a shoggoth must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
be confused (as the spell confusion) for 1d4 rounds. Creatures
that roll a natural 20 on this saving throw become immune to
the Hideous Piping for 24 hours. Otherwise, characters who
meet the conditions must repeat the saving throw every round.

**Keen Senses.** A shoggoth has advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

**Rolling Charge.** If the shoggoth moves at least 20 feet straight
toward a creature and hits it with a slam attack on the same
turn, that creature must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving
throw or be knocked prone. If the creature is knocked prone,
the shoggoth immediately moves into the creature’s space
as a bonus action and crushes the creature beneath its bulk.
The crushed creature can’t breathe, is restrained, and takes
11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the
shoggoth’s turns. A crushed creature remains in its space
and does not move with the shoggoth. A crushed creature
can escape by using an action and making a successful DC
19 Strength check. On a success, the creature crawls into an
empty space within 5 feet of the shoggoth.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The shoggoth makes 1d4 + 1 slam attacks.
Reroll the number of attacks at the start of each of the
shoggoth’s turns.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage, and the target is
grappled (escape DC 18) and restrained. The shoggoth can
grapple any number of creatures simultaneously, and this has
no effect on its number of attacks.
