Shroud
------

*Shrouds appear much like they did in life, only translucent and
immaterial. Their voices are weak.*

**Bitter Spirits.** Shrouds are transitional creatures: remnants
of wicked people who died but refuse to rest in peace, yet
have not grown strong enough to become shadows. They are
aggressive enemies of all living creatures and the light that
nurtures life. Shrouds blend naturally into darkness, but they
stand out starkly in bright light.

**Thin Outlines.** Shrouds look like flickering shadowy outlines
of the people they were before they died, retaining the same
height and body type.

**Repetitive Speech.** Shrouds cannot converse, but they
occasionally can be heard cruelly whispering a name, term,
or phrase over and over again: something that must have had
meaning to them in life.

**Undead Nature.** A shroud doesn’t require air, food, drink,
or sleep.

**Shadow Evolution.** A shrouds instantly becomes a :ref:`srd:shadow` once
it causes a total of 12 damage. Any damage they’ve suffered
is subtracted from the shadow’s total hit points or abilities.

**Shroud Stealth.** When in dim light or darkness, the shroud can
take the Hide action as a bonus action.

**Sunlight Weakness.** While in sunlight, the shroud has
disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Strength Drain.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature. *Hit:* 3 (1d4 + 1) necrotic damage, and the target’s
Strength score is reduced by one-half that amount. The target
dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction
lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. If a non-evil
humanoid dies from this attack, a new :ref:`srd:shadow` rises from the
corpse 1d4 hours later.
