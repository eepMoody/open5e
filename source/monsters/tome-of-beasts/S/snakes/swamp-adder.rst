Snake, Swamp Adder
------------------

*A vicious snake with a squat, diamond-shaped head, a puffed
neck, and a peculiar yellow band around its body, the swamp
adder is a stout, somewhat lethargic hunter.*

**Marsh Hunter.** This venomous snake—sometimes known
as the “speckled band”—is native to the marshes of southern
realms, where it devours waterfowl and incautious halflings.

**Bred for Venom.** The swamp adder is simultaneously feared
and prized for its potent paralytic venom. A swamp adder is
quite thin, though it may grow up to 12 feet long and the largest
weigh as much as 50 pounds. A dose of paralytic swamp adder
venom is worth 3,000 gp or more on the black market.
