Skitterhaunt
------------

*This large vermin moves erratically, leaking noxious fluid from its
cracked exoskeleton.*

**Ooze Vermin.** This parasitic ooze lives in the shells of
monstrous vermin, such as scorpions and spiders, that it has
infested and killed. A skitterhaunt creature might be mistaken
for its original, living version at a glance, but the sluggish, erratic
movements and oozing carapace of skitterhaunts quickly reveal
their true nature.

**Wide Range of Prey.** A skitterhaunt infection can decimate
whole nests of vermin. When those are in short supply, these
oozes move on to prey on other species, such as ants, crabs,
tosculi, and sometimes even zombies or reptiles.

**Hosts Required.** Skitterhaunts can’t survive long outside
their host creatures; they quickly liquefy and lose their cohesion.
A body abandoned by a skitterhaunt is an eerie, hollowed-out
husk with a strong, acidic odor.

**Broken Shell.** A creature that hits the skitterhaunt with a melee
attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) acid damage.

**Infest Vermin.** If the skitterhaunt damages a Medium or smaller
beast, it can try to infest it as a bonus action. The damaged
creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw
against disease or become poisoned until the disease is
cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the
saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on
a failure. If the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0,
the skitterhaunt has devoured the creature’s insides and the
affected becomes a skitterhaunt, retaining its outward shell but
replacing its flesh with skitterhaunt ooze.
