Uraeus
------

*A sleek serpent wends through the air, held aloft on
bronze-feathered wings. The flying cobra flares
its hood and hisses, hurling a spray of orange
sparks from its fanged mouth.*

A uraeus resembles a vibrantly colored cobra.
The serpent’s scales are the rich gold-flecked
blue of lapis lazuli and its eyes gleam white,
but its most distinguishing feature is a pair
of feathery bronze wings. It glides gracefully
through the air with a deliberate vigilance that
reveals its intelligence. A uraeus grows up to
three feet long, and weighs around 5 pounds.

**Divine Protectors.** Uraeuses are celestial
creatures that carry a spark of divine fire within
them, and they thirst for purpose when they arrive
on the Material Plane. Whether the creature was
deliberately summoned or found its way to the
Material Plane through other means, a uraeus is
created to protect. Once it finds a worthy charge, it
devotes its fiery breath and searing venom to protecting
that ward.

A uraeus is fanatically loyal to the creature it protects.
Only gross mistreatment or vicious evil can drive a uraeus to
break its bond and leave.

**Flyby.** The uraeus doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it
flies out of an enemy’s reach.

**Ward Bond.** As a bonus action, the uraeus forms a magical
bond with a willing creature within 5 feet. Afterward, no
matter how great the distance between them, the uraeus
knows the distance and direction to its bonded ward and is
aware of the creature’s general state of health. The bond lasts
until the uraeus or the ward dies, or the uraeus ends the bond
as an action.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage, and
the target must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving
throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way,
the target takes 9 (2d8) fire damage at the start of its turn. A
poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its
turn, ending the effect on a success.

**Searing Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The uraeus exhales a 15-foot
cone of fire. Creatures in the area take 10 (3d6) fire damage, or
half damage with a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Bonded Savior.** When the uraeus’ bonded ward takes damage,
the uraeus can transfer the damage to itself instead. The
uraeus’ damage resistance and immunity don’t apply to
transferred damage.
