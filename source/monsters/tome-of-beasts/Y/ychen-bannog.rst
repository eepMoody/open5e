Ychen Bannog
------------

*Ychen bannogs are massive, ox-like beasts with thick, wooly coats
and great horns like the gods’ battering rams. They stand over
40 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh hundreds of tons. Despite
their awe-inspiring size, these towering creatures are peaceful
wanderers in the wilderness, where their calls echo for miles.*

**Strongest Beasts in the World.** Legends are built on their
sturdy backs. Capable of pulling 670 tons (or carrying 134 tons
on their backs), ychen bannogs are the strongest beasts of burden
in the known world. Tamed ychen bannogs can haul entire
communities, or even small castles, and a clever dwarf with a
ychen bannog at her disposal can carve out enormous riverbeds,
haul enormous stones, or reshape entire valleys with ease.
Ychen Warships. Giants have a particular affinity with the
ychen bannogs. In times of war, giants sometimes build complex
siege platforms atop these beasts, making effective transport
for small armies of giants. Thankfully, ychen bannogs are rare
enough that even seeing one in an army is a tale to be told for
generations.

**Louder Than Thunder.** When riled, a ychen bannog can
bellow loudly enough to shatter stones and knock down walls.

**Ever-Sharp Horns.** The ychen bannog deals
triple damage dice when it scores a critical
hit with a gore attack.

**Overrun.** When the ychen bannog takes the
Dash action, it can move through the space
of a Large or smaller creature, treating the
creature’s space as difficult terrain. As it
moves through the creature’s space, the
ychen bannog can make a stomp attack as
a bonus action.

**Peaceful Creature.** The ychen bannog
abhors combat and flees from it if
possible. If unable to flee, the ychen
bannog can attack a foe or obstacle
to clear a path to safety. As an action,
a driver or handler mounted on the
ychen bannog or adjacent to it can
make a DC 16 Wisdom (Animal
Handling) check. On a success, the ychen bannog moves and
attacks as directed by the driver. On a failure, the beast flees.
The driver or handler must have proficiency in Animal Handling
to attempt this check.
