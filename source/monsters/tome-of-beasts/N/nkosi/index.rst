Nkosi
-----

With a thick mane of beaded locks, these powerful-looking bestial
humanoids grin with a huge mouthful of pointed teeth—as befits a
shapeshifter that can turn into a noble lion.

**Beads and Braids.** The nkosi resemble bestial humans with
cat’s eyes, slender tails, and the fangs and fur of a lion. Most
grow their hair long, braiding colorful beads into their locks to
mark important events in their lives. Although the nkosi’s true
form is that of a feline humanoid with leonine features, the most
striking feature of the nkosi is their ability to change their shape,
taking the form of a lion. Although comfortable in the wilds,
nkosi can adapt to any environment.

**Clawlike Blades.** In combat, they favor curved blades,
wielded in a brutal fighting style in concert with snapping
lunges using their sharp teeth. They prefer light armor
decorated with bone beads, fetishes, and similar tokens taken
from beasts they’ve slain.

**Pridelords.** Nkosi
pridelords are
exceptionally tall and
muscular members of the
race, and they are leaders among
their kin. Pridelords feature
impressive manes but they are more
famous for their powerful roar, which wakes the feral heart
inside all members of this race.
