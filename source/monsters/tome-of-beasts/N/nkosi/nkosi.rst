**Shapechanger.** The nkosi can use its action to polymorph into
a Medium lion or back into its true form. While in lion form,
the nkosi can’t speak, and its speed is 50 feet. Other than its
speed, its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment
it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true
form if it dies.

**Keen Smell.** The nkosi has advantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on smell.

**Hunter’s Maw.** If the nkosi moves at least 20 feet straight
toward a creature and then hits it with a scimitar attack on
the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength
saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is knocked
prone, the nkosi can immediately make one bite attack against
it as a bonus action.
