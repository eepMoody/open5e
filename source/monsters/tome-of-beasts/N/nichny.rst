Nichny
------

*These ancient creatures resemble
nothing so much as black cats dressed
in sumptuous, if archaic, clothing.*

**Xenophobic.** The nichny are highly
xenophobic and gleefully carnivorous fey who dwell in
deep, primeval forests.

**True and False Prophets.** They can dispense luck to
those they like and they certainly have oracular powers,
but they rarely share their prophecies with outsiders. Their
prophecies are always delivered in triples, and legend holds
that two inevitably prove true and one proves false.

**Answer Three Questions.** One final legend
claims that if a nichny can be bound with gold
or orichalcum chains, it must answer three
questions. As with their prophecies, two answers
will be true and one will be a lie. All three questions
must be posed before any will be answered. When the
third answer is given, the nichny and the chains disappear.

**Freedom of Movement.** A nichny ignores difficult terrain and
cannot be entangled, grappled, or otherwise impeded in its
movements as if it is under the effect of a constant freedom of
movement spell. This ability is negated for grapple attempts if
the attacker is wearing gold or orichalcum gauntlets or using a
gold or orichalcum chain as part of its attack.

**Imbue Luck (1/Day).** Nichny can enchant a small gem or stone
to bring good luck. If the nichny gives this lucky stone to
another creature, the bearer receives a +1 bonus to all saving
throws for 24 hours.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The nichny’s innate spellcasting ability
is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It
can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material
components:

**At Will:** detect magic, invisibility, magic missile, ray of frost

**3/day each:** blink, dimension door, haste, polymorph (self only)

**1/day each:** teleport, word of recall

**Luck Aura.** A nichny is surrounded by an aura of luck. All
creatures it considers friends within 10 feet of the nichny gain
a +1 bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.
Creatures that it considers its enemies take a -1 penalty to
attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. The nichny can
activate or suppress this aura on its turn as a bonus action.

**Magic Resistance.** The nichny has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

**Soothsaying.** Once per week, a nichny can answer up to three
questions about the past, present, or future. All three questions
must be asked before the nichny can give its answers, which
are short and may be in the form of a paradox or riddle. One
answer always is false, and the other two must be true.
