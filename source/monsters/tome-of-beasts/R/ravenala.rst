Ravenala
--------

*Ravenalas guard tropical forests and watch after local flora and
fauna. Their heads are crowned by long-stemmed, green-paddled
fronds and spiked seed pods, and their dangling arms end in
hooked wooden talons.*

**Leafy Advisors.** Tribal humanoids respect and venerate
ravenelas, and sometimes seek their advice or magical aid at
times of great need. Ravenalas seldom interact with other
species unless approached and questioned.

**Prisoners Lamentation.** Unlike treants, ravenalas avoid
physical conflict in favor of magical responses. If annoyed, they
imprison hostile creatures within their trunks rather than killing
or eating them. Trapped creatures must sing their own lament as
they are carried off to a distant, dangerous locale.

Ravenalas grow to about 20 feet tall and can weigh 1,800 lb.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The ravenala’s innate spellcasting ability
is Wisdom (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** entangle, sleep

**1/day each:** heal, wall of thorns

**Green Walk.** The ravenala can move across undergrowth,
natural or magical, without needing to make an ability check
and without expending additional movement.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The ravenala makes two slam attacks or two
bursting pod attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

**Bursting Pod.** Melee Ranged Attack: +8 to hit, range 30/120
ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the
target and all creatures within 5 feet of it also take 5 (2d4)
piercing damage, or half as much piercing damage with a
successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

**Lamenting Engulfment.** The ravenala targets a creature within
5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity
saving throw or be grappled and restrained by the ravenala.
While restrained, the creature is engulfed inside the ravenala’s
trunk. The ravenala can grapple one creature at a time;
grappling doesn’t prevent it from using other attacks against
different targets. The restrained creature must make a DC
14 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On
a failure, the creature is compelled to sing a lament of all
its various mistakes and misdeeds for as long as it remains
restrained. Singing prevents uttering command words, casting
spells with a verbal component, or any verbal communication.
The restrained creature can still make melee attacks. When
the ravenala moves, the restrained creature moves with it. A
restrained creature can escape by using an action to make a
DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and
enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the ravenala.
