Ratfolk
-------

*Ratfolk are the size of halflings, though smaller in girth and
quicker in their movements. At a glance they might even be
mistaken for halflings if not for their twitching snouts, bony feet,
and long, pink tails.*

The ratfolk are canny survivors, rogues and tricksters all. Their
strong family ties make it easy for them to found or join criminal
societies--though others serve as expert scouts and saboteurs,
able to infiltrate army camps, city sewers, and even castle
dungeons with equal ease. Ratfolk leaders are often spellcasters
and rogues.

**Adaptable.** Ratfolk swim well and can survive on little.
Some groups are endemic to tropical and
subtropical islands. Others inhabit
forests, sewers, labyrinths, and
ancient, ruined cities.

**Fast Fighters.** Ratfolk prefer
light weapons and armor, fighting
with speed and using numbers to bring a foe down. They have
been known to ally themselves with goblins, darakhul, and
kobolds on occasion, but more often prefer to serve a “Rat
King” who may or may not be a rat of any kind. Such rat rulers
might include a wererat, a rat king, an ogre, a minor demon or
intelligent undead.
