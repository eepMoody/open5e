**Born of Rime.** A rime worm can breathe air or water with equal
ease.

**Ringed by Ice and Death.** A rime worm is surrounded by an
aura of cold, necrotic magic. At the start of the rime worm’s
turn, enemies within 5 feet take 2 (1d4) cold damage plus 2
(1d4) necrotic damage. If two or more enemies take damage
from the aura on a single turn, the rime worm’s black ice spray
recharges immediately.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The rime worm makes two tendril attacks.

**Tendril.** *Melee Weapon Attack.* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage. If both tendril attacks hit the
same target in a single turn, that target is grappled (escape DC
15). The rime worm can grapple one creature at a time, and it
can’t use its tendril or devour attacks against a different target
while it has a creature grappled.

**Devour.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 18 (2d12 + 5) slashing damage. If the target was grappled
by the rime worm, it takes an additional 13 (2d12) cold damage.

**Black Ice Spray (Recharge 5-6).** The rime worm sprays slivers of
ice in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. All creatures in the line
take 26 (4d12) necrotic damage and are blinded; a successful
DC 15 Constitution saving throw prevents the blindness. A
blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn,
ending the effect on itself with a successful save.
