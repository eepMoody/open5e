Rime Worm
---------

*These long, crusty slugs sparkle like ice. A gaping hole at one end
serves as a mouth, from which long tendrils emanate.*

Rime worms are sometimes kept as guards by frost giants.

**Ice Burrowers.** The rime wormâ€™s tendrils help it to burrow
through ice and snow as well absorb sustenance from prey.
Their pale, almost translucent, skin is coated with ice crystals,
making them difficult to spot in their snowy habitat.

**Spray Black Ice.** The worms are fierce hunters, and their
ability to spray skewers of ice and rotting flesh makes them
extremely dangerous.
