Rotting Wind
------------

A rotting wind brings a chilling gust to the air, turning nearby
foliage to rot and raising a sense of dread in all creatures in its path.

**Air of Tombs.** A rotting wind is an undead creature made up of
the foul air and grave dust sloughed off by innumerable undead
creatures within lost tombs and grand necropoli.

**Scouts for Undead Armies.** A rotting wind carries the foul
stench of death upon it, sometimes flying before undead armies
and tomb legions or circling around long-extinct cities and
civilizations.

**Withering Crops.** Rotting winds sometimes drifts
mindlessly across a moor or desert, blighting all life they find
and leaving only famine and death in its wake. This is especially
dangerous when they drift across fields full of crops; they can
destroy an entire harvest in minutes.

**Undead Nature.** A rotting wind doesn't require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Wind of Decay.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 0 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6)
necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with tomb
rot. The cursed target can’t regain hit points, and its hit point
maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse.
If the curse reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the
target dies and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until
removed by the remove curse spell or comparable magic.
