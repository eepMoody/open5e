Roachling
---------

*The creature is humanoid but disturbingly roachlike. Its legs are too
short, its arms too long, its skin is oily, and its back is covered by a
carapace. Atop those features sits an incongruously humanlike face.*

Combining the worst of human and cockroach qualities, these
nimble creatures have a talent for stealth and for fighting dirty.
Also known as scuttlers, roachlings are an unpleasant humanoid
race—inquisitive and covetous, unclean and ill-mannered—and
most other races shun them.

**Devious Combatants.** Roachlings are skittish and easily
frightened, but they aren’t cowards. Rather, they are practical
about their weaknesses. They understand survival often depends
on remaining unseen and out of reach. Most roachlings prefer to
fight only when the chance for victory sits squarely on their side.

They also have a well-deserved reputation for deviousness.
Roachlings are adept at skulking, underhanded tactics, and
hit‑and-run fighting. Filth and trickery are their most useful tools.

**Deeply Paranoid.** Because they have long been hunted and
persecuted, roachlings are naturally suspicious, and they extend
their trust slowly. A deep-rooted paranoia infects the race, and
unsurprisingly their paranoia often turns out to be justified.

**Fused Carapace.** Roachlings have prominent, whip-like
antennae, a carapace covering much of their backs, and small
spines on their legs and arms. They have short, noticeably bowed
legs. Hair is unusual among roachlings, but when present, it’s
always oily and dark, pressed flat against the skull.
Roachling coloration varies across tan, yellow, dark brown,
and black. Regardless of color, their thick, hardened skin appears
shiny and slightly oily although it is dry. Roachlings have an
internal skeleton, however, not the exoskeleton of a true insect.
