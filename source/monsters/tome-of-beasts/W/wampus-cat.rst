Wampus Cat
----------

*A raven-haired young woman rises to the surface of the water as
she swims, singing softly to herself—and her lower body is that of
a mountain lion. Her sweet song turns to a yowl of rage when she
spots prey.*

Wampus cats are all born from an ancient shaman’s curse.
Trollkin, orc, goblin, and human shamans alike all claim to
be able to transform those who practice forbidden magic into
wampus cats.

**Forest Streams.** The wampus cat stalks the shores of woodland
waterways, using her magic to disguise her true form and lure
unsuspecting victims to the water’s edge. She is particularly fond
of attacking bathers or those pulling water from a stream.

**Hatred of the Holy.** While she prefers to feast on intelligent
male humanoids, she holds a special animosity toward and
hunger for holy men of any kind. Unless near starvation or if
provoked, however, she will not kill women. Indeed, a wampus
cat may strike up a temporary friendship with any woman who is
having difficulties with men, though these friendships typically
last only as long as their mutual enemies live. Some witches are
said to command gain their trust and keep them as companions.

**Swamp Team Ups.** Will-o’-wisps and miremals enjoy working
in tandem with wampus cats; the wisps alter their light to mimic
the flicker of a torch or candle and illuminate the disguised cat,
the better to lure in victims, then assist the cat in the ensuing
battle. Miremals use a tall story to lure travelers into a swamp
when the hour grows late, then abandon them.

*Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

**Yowl (Recharge 5–6).** Intelligent creatures within 60 feet of the
cat who are able to hear its voice must make a DC 13 Charisma
saving throw. Those who fail find the sound of the wampus
cat’s voice pleasant and alluring, so that the cat has advantage
on Charisma checks against them for 1 minute. The affected
characters cannot attack the wampus cat during this time
unless they are wounded in that time.
