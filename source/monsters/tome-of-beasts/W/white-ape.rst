White Ape
---------

*This hulking primate looms over others of its kind. Its filthy
white fur is matted and yellowed, and a deranged look haunts
its blood-red eyes.*

**Awakened by Sorcery.** White apes were once docile, gentle
giants that roamed forested hills and savannah lands. Two
thousand years ago, a kingdom of mages awakened the apes,
raising their intelligence to near-human level so the beasts could
be employed as soldiers and servants, protecting and replacing
the humans who were slowly dying off. When the sorcerers died
out, the apes remained.

**Arcane Wasting.** The enchantment that imbued the apes with
intelligence also bleached their fur white and made them carriers
of the arcane wasting, a disease that hastened their creators’
demise. The apes are immune to the wasting’s effects, but they
can pass it to other humanoids. Among spellcasters, the wasting
spreads like a plague.

**Driven Away.** The awakening enchantment also gave the white
apes a strong desire to serve humans, but because of the risk
from the disease, they are viciously driven away from settled
areas. They are acutely aware of the injustice that was done
to them, and generations of exile have turned their loyalty to
animosity, especially toward arcane spellcasters.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The ape makes one bite attack and two claw
attacks.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed
on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or contract the arcane
wasting disease (see sidebar).

   The sidebars in Tome of Beasts are not Open Game Content, so we can't
   include the details in arcane wasting disease here.

   Feel free to make up your own very serious disease with the same name!

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage.

**Frenzy (1/Day).** When two or more foes are adjacent to the ape,
it can enter a deadly battle frenzy. Instead of using its normal
multiattack, a frenzied white ape makes one bite attack and
two claw attacks against each enemy within 5 feet of it. Melee
attacks against the white ape are made with advantage from
the end of that turn until the start of the white ape’s next turn.
