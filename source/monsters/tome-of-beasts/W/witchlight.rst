Witchlight
----------

*This tiny ball of bright light seems to emanate from a
crystalline center.*

**Wizard Servants.** Also called a “spooklight,” a
witchlight is a wizard’s servant created from a tiny piece
of quartz. It appears as a floating ball of flickering
light similar to a will-o’-wisp. The hue of quartz used
during the creature’s creation determines the color
of each witchlight’s illumination. After the quartz is
prepared, it is animated through an extended magical
ritual cast under a full moon and a clear, starry sky.
Consequently, they are extremely rare by any measure.

**Flashing Light Code.** A witchlight always shares
the same alignment as its creator. Although it cannot
speak, a witchlight understands Common or another
language taught it by its creator. Many spellcasters have
taught their witchlights a coded cipher, so it can spell out
words by flaring and dimming its light. When necessary, a
witchlight can spell words in the air by flying so quickly that
its trail of light forms letters. This stunt requires a successful
DC 14 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check per word.

**Free Roaming.** If the witchlight’s master dies within one mile
of the witchlight, it explodes in a brilliant but harmless flash
of light. If it loses its master under any other circumstance, it
becomes masterless; it’s free to do as it pleases, and it can never
serve anyone else as a familiar. The statistics below represent
these independent witchlights.

Evil witchlights can be surprisingly cruel, not unlike will-o’wisps. They seek to lure lost travelers into swamps or traps by
using their glow to imitate the light of a safe haven. Conversely,
good-aligned witchlights guide travelers to places of safety
or along safe paths, and they are prized by pilots and guides.
Neutral witchlights exhibit a playful nature—sometimes
mingling inside the cavities of weapons, gems, or other
curiosities, which means those items may be mistaken for magic
items. More than one “wizard’s staff ” is just an impressivelooking stick with a witchlight perched on top.

**Constructed Nature.** A witchlight doesn't require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

cannot extinguish its light. Because of its glow, the witchlight
has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
