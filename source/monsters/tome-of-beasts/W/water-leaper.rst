Water Leaper
------------

*The water leaper is a frogheaded, legless
creature with wide batlike wings and a gaping
maw. Its shrieks resemble those of a hawk. Its long,
sinuous tail tapers and ends in a venomous barb.*

**Gliding Wings.** The creature has no legs or arms, but
sports a pair of wide, membranous wings. It uses the
wings to glide beneath the water, as well as to soar
through the air.

**Scourge of Waterways.** Water leapers plague fresh
lakes and rivers. The creatures prey on animals that come
to the water’s edge to drink, as well as on fishermen that
ply their trade in the water leaper’s territory. Stories circulate
among fishermen of fishing grounds notorious for broken lines
and missing bait, and fishermen give these areas a wide berth
for fear of water leapers. Desperate or unwary fishermen who
ignore the warnings are never seen again; drifting, empty boats
are the only sign of their passing.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The water leaper uses its shriek and makes one
bite attack and one stinger attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage and the target is :ref:`srd:grappled`
(escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is :ref:`srd:restrained`
and the water leaper can’t bite another target.

**Shriek.** The water leaper lets out a blood-curdling shriek.
Every creature within 40 feet that can hear the water leaper
must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or
be :ref:`srd:frightened` until the start of the water leaper’s next turn. A
creature that successfully saves against the shriek is immune to
the effect for 24 hours.

**Stinger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage and the target must make
a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be :ref:`srd:poisoned`
for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the creature takes
7 (2d6) poison damage at the start of its turn. A poisoned
creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending
the effect on a success.

**Swallow.** The water leaper makes a bite attack against a
medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack
hits, the target is swallowed and the grapple ends. The
swallowed target is :ref:`srd:blinded` and :ref:`srd:restrained`, and has total
cover against attacks and other effects outside the water
leaper. A swallowed target takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the
start of the water leaper’s turn. The water leaper can have
one creature swallowed at a time. If the water leaper dies, the
swallowed creature is no longer restrained and can use 5 feet
of movement to crawl, :ref:`srd:prone`, out of the corpse.
