**Amphibious.** A deep one priest can breathe air or water with
equal ease.

**Frenzied Rage.** On its next turn after a deep one hybrid priest
takes 10 or more damage from a single attack, it has advantage
on its melee attacks and adds +4 to spell and claws damage.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The deep one priest’s innate spellcasting
ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell
attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no
material components:

**At will:** sacred flame, shocking grasp

**3/day each:** inflict wounds, sanctuary, sleep

**1/day each:** ice storm, shatter

**Lightless Depths.** A deep one hybrid priest is immune to the
pressure effects of the deep ocean.

**Ocean Change.** A deep one born to a human family resembles
a human child, but transforms into an adult deep one between
the ages of 16 and 30.

**Voice of the Deeps.** A deep one priest may sway an audience of
listeners with its rolling, droning speech, fascinating them for 5
minutes and making them dismiss or forget what they’ve seen
recently unless they make a successful DC 13 Wisdom saving
throw at the end of that period. If the saving throw succeeds,
they remember whatever events the deep one sought to erase.
