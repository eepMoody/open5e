**Potent Poison.** The death butterfly swarm’s poison affects
corporeal undead who are otherwise immune to poison.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and
vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening
large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can’t regain hit
points or gain temporary hit point.

**Weight of Wings.** A creature in a space occupied by the death
butterfly swarm has its speed reduced by half, and must
succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or become blinded.
Both effects end when the creature doesn’t share a space
with the swarm at the end of the creature’s turn. If a creature
succeeds on the saving throw, it is immune to the swarm’s
blindness (but not the speed reduction) for 24 hours.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack:** The swarm makes a Bite attack against every
target in its spaces.

**Bites.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 0 ft., every target
in the swarm’s space. *Hit:* 22 (6d6 +1) piercing damage, or
11 (3d6 + 1) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit
points or fewer. The target also takes 10 (3d6) poison damage
and becomes poisoned for 1d4 rounds; a successful DC 13
Constitution saving throw reduces poison damage by half and
prevents the poisoned condition..
