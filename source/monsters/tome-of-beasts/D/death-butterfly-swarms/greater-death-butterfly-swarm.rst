**Potent Poison.** The death butterfly swarm’s poison affects
corporeal undead who are otherwise immune to poison.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and
vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening
large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can’t regain hit
points or gain temporary hit point.

**Weight of Wings.** A creature in a space occupied by the death
butterfly swarm has its speed reduced by half, and must
succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or become :ref:`srd:blinded`.
Both effects end when the creature doesn’t share a space
with the swarm at the end of the creature’s turn. If a creature
succeeds on the saving throw, it is immune to the swarm’s
blindness (but not the speed reduction) for 24 hours.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack:** The swarm makes a Bite attack
against every target in its spaces.

**Bites.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit,
reach 0 ft., every target in the
swarm’s space. *Hit:* 24 (6d6 +3)
piercing damage, or 13
(3d6 + 3) piercing damage
if the swarm has half of
its hit points or fewer.
The target also
takes 17 (5d6)
poison damage
and becomes
:ref:`srd:poisoned` for 1d4
rounds; a successful DC
15 Constitution saving
throw reduces poison
damage by half and
prevents the
poisoned condition.
