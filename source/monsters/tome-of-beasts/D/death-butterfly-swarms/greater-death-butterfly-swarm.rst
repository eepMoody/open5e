Greater Death Butterfly Swarm
-----------------------------

*These enormous clouds of orange and green butterflies add a reek of
putrefaction to the air, stirred by the flapping of their delicate wings.*

**Demon-Haunted.** A death butterfly swarm results when a rare
breed of carrion-eating butterflies, drawn to the stench of great
decay, feeds on the corpse of a fiend, demon, or similar creature.

**Dizzying and Poisonous.** The colorful and chaotic flapping of
the insects’ wings blinds and staggers those in its path, allowing
the swarm to necrotize more flesh from those it overruns.
Attracted to rotting material, the swarm spreads a fast-acting,
poison on its victims, creating carrion it can feed on immediately.

**Devour the Undead.** Undead creatures are not immune to a
death butterfly swarm’s poison, and a swarm can rot an undead
creature’s animating energies as easily as those of the living.
Given the choice between an undead and living creature, a death
butterfly swarm always attacks the undead. Such swarms find
ghouls and vampires particularly appealing. Some good-aligned
forces regard summoning these swarms as a necessary evil.

**Potent Poison.** The death butterfly swarm’s poison affects
corporeal undead who are otherwise immune to poison.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and
vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening
large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can’t regain hit
points or gain temporary hit point.

**Weight of Wings.** A creature in a space occupied by the death
butterfly swarm has its speed reduced by half, and must
succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or become blinded.
Both effects end when the creature doesn’t share a space
with the swarm at the end of the creature’s turn. If a creature
succeeds on the saving throw, it is immune to the swarm’s
blindness (but not the speed reduction) for 24 hours.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack:** The swarm makes a Bite attack
against every target in its spaces.

**Bites.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit,
reach 0 ft., every target in the
swarm’s space. *Hit:* 24 (6d6 +3)
piercing damage, or 13
(3d6 + 3) piercing damage
if the swarm has half of
its hit points or fewer.
The target also
takes 17 (5d6)
poison damage
and becomes
poisoned for 1d4
rounds; a successful DC
15 Constitution saving
throw reduces poison
damage by half and
prevents the
poisoned condition.
