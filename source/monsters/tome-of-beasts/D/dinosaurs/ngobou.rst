Dinosaur, Ngobou
----------------

*This ill-tempered, six-horned creature resembles a triceratops the
size of an ox, with pairs of horns atop its nose and brows, as well as
great tusks jutting from each side of its mouth.*

**Hatred of Elephants.** Ngobous are ox-sized dinosaurs often
at war with elephants over territory. Ngobous are irascible and
suspicious by nature, prone to chasing after any creature that
stays too long inside its territory. They also become aggressive
when they can see or smell elephants. Even old traces of
elephants’ scent are sufficient to trigger an ngobou’s rage.

**Poor Beasts of War.** Grasslands tribes sometimes try to train
ngobous as beasts of burden or war, but most have given up on
the ill-tempered animals; their behavior is too erratic, especially
if elephants are nearby or have been in the area recently.

**Trample Crops.** Ngobou herds can smash entire crops flat in
minutes—and their horns can tear through a herd of goats or
cattle in little time as well.

**Trampling Charge.** If the ngobou moves at least 20 feet
straight toward a creature and then hits it with a gore attack
on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13
Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is
prone, the ngobou can make one stomp attack against it as a
bonus action.

**Elephants’ Bane.** The ngobou has advantage on attacks against
elephants. It can detect by scent whether an elephant has been
within 180 feet of its location anytime in the last 48 hours.

**Spikes.** A creature that grapples an ngobou takes 9 (2d8)
piercing damage.
