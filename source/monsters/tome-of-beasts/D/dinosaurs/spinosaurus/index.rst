Dinosaur, Spinosaurus
---------------------

*A spinosaurus is a land and riverine predator capable of carrying
a platoon of lizardfolk long distances on raids. Often called a river
king or river dragon, they are worshipped by bullywugs and other
primitive humanoids.*

**Friend to Lizardfolk.** The spinosaurus is a special saurian
bred for size and loyalty by lizardfolk. Lizardfolk prize them like
prime warhorses, and lavish them with food and care.

**Enormous Size and Color.** This immense saurian has a long
tooth-filled maw, powerful claws, and colorful spines running
the length of its spine. An adult dire spinosaurus is 70 feet long
and weighs 35,000 pounds or more, and a young spinosaurus is
20 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds or more.

**Swift Predator.** A spinosaurus is quick on both land and
water.
