Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one bite attack and two
claw attacks.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage, and the target loses 3
hit point from bleeding at the start of each of its turns for six
rounds unless it receives magical healing. Bleeding damage is
cumulative; the target loses 3 hp per round for each bleeding
wound it has taken from a mithral dragon’s claws.

**Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6).** A mithral dragon can spit
a 50-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line of metallic shards. Targets
in its path take 21 (6d6) magical slashing damage and lose
another 5 hit points from bleeding at the start of their turns
for 6 rounds; slashing damage is halved by a successful DC 12
Dexterity saving throw, but bleeding damage is not affected.
Only magical healing stops the bleeding before 6 rounds. The
shards dissolve into wisps of smoke 1 round after the breath
weapon’s use.
