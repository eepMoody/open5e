Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then
makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 22 (2d12 + 9) piercing damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 18 (2d8 +9) slashing damage, and the target loses 5 hit
point from bleeding at the start of each of its turns for six
rounds unless it receives magical healing. Bleeding damage is
cumulative; the target loses 5 hp per round for each bleeding
wound it’s taken from a mithral dragon’s claws.

**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 20 (2d10 + 9) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that
is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed
on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for 1
minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is
immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6).** A mithral dragon can spit a
60-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line of metallic shards. Targets in its
path take 59 (17d6) magical slashing damage and lose another
10 hit points from bleeding at the start of their turns for 6
rounds; slashing and bleed damage is halved by a successful
DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. Only magical healing stops the
bleeding before 6 rounds. The shards dissolve into wisps of
smoke 1 round after the breath weapon’s use.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used
at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The
dragon regains spent legendary actions at the
start of its turn.

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom
(Perception) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The
dragon beats its wings. Each creature
within 10 feet of the dragon must
succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity
saving throw or take 18 (2d8 + 9)
bludgeoning damage and be
knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. The dragon can
then fly up to half its flying speed.
