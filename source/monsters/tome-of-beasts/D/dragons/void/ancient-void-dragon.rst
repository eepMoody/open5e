**Chill of the Void.** Cold damage dealt by the void dragon
ignores resistance to cold damage, but not cold immunity.

**Collapsing Star.** When the void dragon is killed it explodes in a
swath of celestial destruction. Each creature and object within
1 mile of the dragon take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage, 55
(10d10) cold damage, and 55 (10d10) psychic damage. Each
damage type can be reduced by half with a successful DC 21
saving throw: Dexterity vs. bludgeoning, Constitution vs. cold,
and Wisdom vs. psychic. Additionally, a creature that fails two
or three of the saving throws is affected by a plane shift spell
and sent to a random plane. If it is sent to the plane it currently
occupies, it appears 5d100 miles away in a random direction.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving
throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Void Dweller.** Void dragons dwell in the empty expanse
between the stars, and do not require air, food, drink, or sleep.
When flying between stars the void dragon magically glides on
solar winds, making the immense journey through the void in
an impossibly short time.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Aura of Madness. It then
makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 20 (2d10 + 9) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) cold damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 16 (2d6 + 9) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.

**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage.

**Aura of Madness.** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is
within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed
on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for 1
minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each
of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature
fails the saving throw by 5 or more it is driven insane. An insane
creature is :ref:`srd:frightened` permanently, and behaves as if affected
by :ref:`srd:confusion` while it is frightened in this way. If a creature’s
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is
immune to the dragon’s Aura of Madness for the next 24 hours.

**Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon uses one of the
following breath weapons.

  **Gravitic Breath.** The dragon exhales a 90-foot cube of
  powerful localized gravity, originating from the dragon.
  Falling damage in the area increases to 1d10 per 10 feet
  fallen. When a creature starts its turn within the area or
  enters it for the first time in a turn, including when the
  dragon creates the field, it must make a DC 24 Dexterity
  saving throw. On a failure the creature is :ref:`srd:restrained`. On
  a success the creature’s speed is halved as long as it
  remains in the field. A restrained creature repeats the
  saving throw at the end of its turn. The field persists
  until the dragon’s breath recharges, and it can’t use
  gravitic breath twice consecutively.

  **Stellar Flare Breath.** The dragon exhales star fire
  in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must
  make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45
  (13d6) fire damage and 45 (13d6) radiant damage
  on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
  successful one.

**Teleport.** The dragon magically teleports to any
open space within 100 feet.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Void Twist.** When the dragon is hit by a ranged
attack, it can create a small rift in space to increase
its AC by 7 against that attack. If the attack misses
because of this increase, the dragon can choose a
creature within 30 feet to become the new target for
that attack. Use the original attack roll to determine if
the attack hits the new target.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from
the options below. Only one legendary action option can
be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s
turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start
of its turn.

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Void Slip (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon twists the fabric
of space. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must
succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6)
bludgeoning damage and be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. The dragon can
then teleport to an unoccupied space within 40 feet.

**Void Cache (Costs 3 Actions).** The dragon can magically reach
into its treasure hoard and retrieve one item. If the dragon is
holding an item, it can use this ability to deposit the item into
its hoard.
