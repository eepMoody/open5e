PRIESTS OF SEGGOTAN
-------------------

PRIESTS OF SEGGOTAN
Every sea dragon is devoted to the dragon god of the sea.
As a result, many sea dragons use the innate spellcasting
variant. Sea dragons favor spells that manipulate water
or the weather, emulate storms, deal lightning or cold
damage, divine the future, or conjure sea creatures to fight
alongside the dragon.

SEA DRAGONS IN MIDGARD
Sea dragons are the offspring of Seggotan, the dragon god
of time and the sea. A sea dragon shares its god’s idea that
everything in the sea is the property of Seggotan, and they
expect lesser beings to respect that truth.
The sea dragons are among the most powerful allies
of the Mharoti Empire, securing seaways and acting as
a communion point for the tidal priests. Thankfully for
the Empire’s enemies, the most ancient sea dragons are
too consumed with their contemplation of time and their
inscrutable duties in the depths of the ocean to make war.
