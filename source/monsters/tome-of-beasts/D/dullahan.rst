Dullahan
--------

*The black horse strides out of the shadows with its nostrils huffing
steam. Its rider, swathed in black leather, raises his arm to reveal
not a lantern but its own severed, grinning head.*

Though it appears to be a headless rider astride a black horse, the
dullahan is a single creature. The fey spirit takes the shape of the
rider holding its own head aloft like a lantern, or (more rarely)
the form of an ogre cradling its head in one arm.

**Harbingers of Death.** Hailing from the darkest of fey
courts, the dullahan are macabre creatures that walk hand in
hand with death. They sometimes serve powerful fey lords and
ladies, riding far and wide in the capacity of a herald, bard, or
ambassador. More often than not they carry doom to a wretch
who roused their lord’s ire.

**Relentless Nature.** The dullahan doesn’t require food,
drink, or sleep.

**Baleful Glare.** When a creature that can see the eyes of the
dullahan’s severed head starts its turn within 30 feet of the
dullahan, the dullahan can force it to make a DC 15 Wisdom
saving throw if the dullahan isn’t incapacitated and can see the
creature. On a failed save, the creature is :ref:`srd:frightened` until the
start of its next turn. While frightened in this way the creature
must move away from the dullahan, and can only use its action
to Dash. If the creature is affected by the dullahan’s Deathly
Doom trait, it is :ref:`srd:restrained` while frightened instead.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the
saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it
can’t see the dullahan until the start of its next turn, when it
can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the dullahan in
the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

**Deathly Doom (1/Day).** As a bonus action, the dullahan
magically dooms a creature. The dullahan knows the direction
to the doomed creature as long as it is on the same plane.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The dullahan’s innate spellcasting ability
is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The
dullahan can innately cast the following spells, requiring no
material or somatic components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:bane`, :ref:`srd:chill-touch`, *srd:hex*, :ref:`srd:knock`

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:false-life`, :ref:`srd:see-invisibility`

**1/day:** :ref:`srd:blight`

**Relentless Advance.** The dullahan is unaffected by difficult
terrain, and can ride over water and other liquid surfaces.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dullahan makes two attacks with its spine whip.

**Spine Whip.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage plus 10 (3d10)
necrotic damage. If the target is a creature it must make a DC
15 Constitution saving throw or be wracked with pain and fall
:ref:`srd:prone`.

**Seal the Doom.** The dullahan points at a creature marked by
Deathly Doom within 40 feet than it can see. The creature
must succeed at a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against
this magic or immediately drop to 0 hit points. A creature that
successfully saves is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Interposing Glare.** When the dullahan is hit by a melee attack
it can move its severed head in front of the attacker’s face. The
attacker is affected by the dullahan’s Baleful Glare immediately.
If the creature is averting its eyes this turn, it must still make
the save, but does so with advantage.
