Doppelrat
---------

*This rat startled the moment it knew it was seen. Within seconds,
the one rat became four, and then the four quickly multiplied into
sixteen rats.*

The result of a clone spell gone awry, a doppelrat uses
short‑lived duplicates to overwhelm its adversaries. An
easy battle against a single rat can quickly spiral out of
control as the doppelrat clones itself into a swarm—
and the original rat may hide while combat rages.

**Stillborn Clones.** Those who survive a
doppelrat’s bite suffer from a frightening
disease, sloughing off a stillborn clone
each day as their own vitality fades. These
clones cannot be raised from the dead
in any manner.

Doppelrats settle in large city
alleys and sewers after they have killed
off or driven out normal rats and natural predators. A cat
that survives an encounter with a doppelrat avoids any other
doppelrats it meets. Doppelrats can sense others of their kind;
helpful, since doppelrat litters produce only one truebred
creature out of ten. Their parents and siblings devour the others.

**Clone and Run.** In combat, they spawn as many clones
as they can, and then flee while the copied rats swarm their
opponent. By succeeding at a Perception check opposed by the
doppelrat’s Stealth check, a character can discern the original
from all the clones.

**City Bounties.** In cities with known doppelrat lairs,
magistrates hire spellcasters to scour alleys and sewers and
obliterate any rats they find. Shady spellcasters who capture a live
doppelrat have blackmailed such magistrates by promising to
rescue the town from the rats for an exorbitant fee.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
1 piercing damage.

**Arcane Doubling (recharges after 10 minutes).** A doppelrat
under duress creates clones of itself at the beginning of its
turn. Each round for 4 rounds, the number of live doppelrats
quadruples but never exceeds 20. For example, when the
doppelrat triggers arcane doubling, 1 rat becomes 4; at the
start of the rat’s next turn, those 4 become 16; and at the start
of the rat’s third turn, those 16 become 20, the maximum
allowed. If one of the duplicates was destroyed between the
original doppelrat’s 1st and 2nd turns, then the surviving 3
would become 12, and so on.

Each duplicate appears in the same space as any other rat,
can either move or take an action the round it appears, and
has 4 hit points and AC 13. Any surviving duplicates perish
1 minute (10 rounds) after the first ones were created. If the
original doppelrat dies, its clones stop duplicating but the pre-existing
clones remain until their time expires. A creature can
identify the original doppelrat from its duplicates as an action
by making a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom
(Perception) check.

**Doppeling Disease.** At the end of a dopplerat encounter,
every creature bitten by a doppelrat or its duplicates must
succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract
the degenerate cloning disease. During each long rest,
the diseased creature grows and sloughs off a stillborn
clone. The doppeling process leaves the diseased creature
incapacitated for 1 hour, unable to move and barely able
to speak (spellcasting is impossible in this state). When
the incapacitation wears off, the creature makes a DC 12
Constitution saving throw; it recovers from the disease when it
makes its second successful save. Humanoid clones created by
the disease cannot be brought to life in any manner.
