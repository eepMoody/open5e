Dream Eater
-----------

*This tattered skeletal humanoid resembles a monster
from a nightmare. A dream eater’s natural form is
mostly human in appearance, though with vestigial
skeletal wings with a few feathers, small horns, sharp
teeth, and cloven hooves. Most often they use magic to
disguise themselves as attractive members of a humanoid race.*

**Drawn to Sin.** Dream eaters are dedicated to lust, gluttony,
and greed, and they make their lairs in casinos, brothels,
thieves’ dens, and other locations where gambling, food, and
other pleasures are readily available. Sometimes dream eaters
work together to create such a place, especially near large towns
or cities. Some band together to create traveling shows, offering
all the oddities, whimsies, and flights of fantasy customary for
such entertainers.

**Devouring Hopes.** Dream eaters lure people into their lairs,
enticing them with promises of pleasure or wealth, but they make
sure the odds are stacked in their favor. Eventually, their victims
are left with nothing. Worse than the loss of physical treasures,
though, dream eaters leave their victims stripped of all hopes
and aspirations. Dream eaters feed on their emotions, leaving
helpless thralls willing to sell their souls for their vices.

**Lords of Confusion.** When confronted, dream eaters are
dangerous opponents. Using their innate abilities, they can drive
enemies into a dream state, using the resulting confusion to
make their escape while their foes destroy themselves.

**Shapechanger.** The dream eater can use its turn to polymorph
into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into
its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same
in all forms. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t
transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The dream eater’s innate spellcasting
ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** command

**3/day:** suggestion

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dream eater makes one bite attack and one
claw attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage, and the target is grappled
(escape DC 12).

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 24 (4d10 + 2) slashing damage.

**Dream Eater’s Caress.** A creature that ends its turn grappled
by a dream eater is restrained until the end of its next turn, it
takes 5 (1d4 + 3) psychic damage, and the dream eater gains
the same number of temporary hit points.

**Lotus Scent (Recharge 6).** The dream eater secretes an oily
chemical that most creatures find intoxicating. All living
creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution
saving throw against poison or be poisoned for 2d4 rounds.
While poisoned this way, the creature is stunned. Creatures
that successfully save are immune to that dream eater’s lotus
scent for 24 hours.

**Waking Dreams (1/Day).** Every creature within 20 feet of the
dream eater must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. Those
that fail enter waking dreams and are confused (as the spell)
for 6 rounds. On turns when the creature can act normally
(rolls 9 or 10 for the confusion effect), it can repeat the saving
throw at the end of its turn, and the effect ends early on a
successful save.
