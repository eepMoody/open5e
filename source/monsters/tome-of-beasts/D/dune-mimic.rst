Dune Mimic
----------

*When a dune mimic strikes, the sand surges and shifts, a sinkhole
opens, and sandy tendrils snatch at nearby creatures.*

**Enormous Forms.** Though most commonly seen as dunes, a
dune mimic can take the form of a date palm grove, a riverbank,
an enormous boulder, or other large shapes in the landscape.

**A King’s Guardians.** Dune mimics were created by a
forgotten king as guardians for his desert tomb. Somewhere,
dozens of them guard vast wealth.

**Spread by Spores.** Although not intended to reproduce,
they began producing spores spontaneously and replicating
themselves, so that now they’re spread across the deserts.
Luckily for the other inhabitants, dune mimics reproduce just
once per century.

**Shapechanger.** The dune mimic can use its
action to polymorph into a Huge object
or terrain feature (maximum area 25 x 25
feet) or back into its true, amorphous form.
Since its coating of dust, sand, and gravel
can’t be hidden, it usually disguises itself as a
terrain feature or eroded ruin. Its statistics are the
same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or
carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true
form if it dies.

**Adhesive** (Object or Terrain Form Only). The
dune mimic adheres to anything that touches
it. A creature adhered to the dune mimic is also
grappled by it (escape DC 15). Ability checks
made to escape this grapple have disadvantage.
The dune mimic can harden its outer surface, so
only the creatures it chooses are affected by this trait.

**False Appearance** (Object or Terrain Form Only).
While the dune mimic remains motionless, it is
indistinguishable from an ordinary object or
terrain feature.

**Grappler.** The dune mimic has advantage on attack rolls
against a creature grappled by it.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dune mimic makes four pseudopod attacks.

**Pseudopod.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the dune
mimic is in object or terrain form, the target is subjected to the
mimic’s Adhesive trait.

**Engulf.** The dune mimic engulfs all creatures it has grappled.
An engulfed creature can’t breathe, is restrained, is no longer
grappled, has total cover against attacks and other effects
outside the dune mimic, and takes 18 (4d8) acid damage
at the start of each of the dune mimic’s turns. When the
dune mimic moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An
engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to
make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature
escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the
dune mimic.
