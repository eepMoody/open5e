Paper Drake
-----------

*With its sharp angles and translucent skin, this draconic creature
looks as if it were carefully folded from a massive sheet of paper,
including its razor-sharp claws and teeth.*

**Book and Map Erasers.** These drakes originated in exotic
lands far away, where paper is as common as parchment and
vellum. They now inhabit wide stretches of the world, and they
seem to have edited their origins out of history.
Paper drakes are a bane to historians and spellcasters because
they can erase ink and pigments, and they often do so at random
simply for aesthetic purposes. They adore the possibility of a
blank page, but they also sometimes erase one selectively to
make beautiful patterns in the remaining ink.

**Correcting Errors.** Some paper drakes have a compulsion
to correct errors in text or speech, and in these cases their
strange ability isn’t a nuisance. Indeed, these paper drakes help
scribes correct mistakes, update outdated text, or erase entire
volumes so they can be hand-lettered again with different text.

**Tattoo Magicians.** Paper drakes are sometimes subjected to
strange magical rituals in which wizards tattoo powerful runes
and symbols onto their skin. Those who survive this process gain
even stranger, esoteric abilities, such as the ability to “stamp”
text or images with their feet, the ability to make illustrations
move as if alive, or even the ability to erase the memory of
written words from a person’s mind, much as they erase text
from a page.

In their regular form, paper drakes reach just over four feet in
length and weight around 30 lb. They are usually white or tan,
but develop a brown or yellow tone as they age.

**Shelve.** A paper drake can fold itself into a small, almost flat
form, perfect for hiding on bookshelves. The drake can still be
recognized as something other than a book by someone who
handles it (doesn’t just glance at it on the shelf) and makes a
successful DC 11 Intelligence (Nature or Investigation) check.
The drake can hop or fly (clumsily, by flapping its pages) 5 feet
per turn in this form.

**Refold (Recharge 5-6).** A paper drake can fold its body into
different sizes and shapes. The drake can adjust its size by one
step in either direction, but can’t be smaller than Tiny or larger
than Medium size. Changes in size or shape don’t affect the
paper drake’s stats.
