Alehouse Drake
--------------

*This plump little creature reclines with a dazed look in its eyes and
the suggestion of a grin on its fanged jaws.*

**Scaled Barflies.** Alehouse drakes squat in busy bars, rowdy
taverns, and bustling inns. A bane or savior to every bartender
and innkeeper, alehouse drakes enjoy pushing patrons’
emotions, driving crowds to ecstatic cheers or bloody bar fights.

Alehouse drakes make their homes in cities and towns, though
older drakes settle down in roadside coaching inns. In the
former situations, they are often troublemakers or pranksters,
but in the latter circumstances, they usually befriend the
proprietor and help manage flared tempers and weepy drinkers
in return for living space and a generous tab.

**Relentless Gossips.** Alehouse drakes gossip endlessly.
Perched in hiding places throughout busy taverns, they overhear
many stories, and often trade in information, making them good
sources for news about town. More devious and ill-mannered
alehouse drakes resort to blackmail, but usually only to secure a
comfortable spot in their chosen tavern.

**Family Heirlooms.** Alehouse drakes are one to two feet long
on average and weigh about eighteen lb. with a plump belly.
Their scales are deep amber with cream or white highlights, and
they possess glittering, light-colored eyes. The oldest recorded
alehouse drake lived just past 400 years—some are quite beloved
by innkeeping families, and treated bit like family heirlooms.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The drake’s innate casting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It
can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material
components:

**At will:** *friends*, :ref:`srd:vicious-mockery`

**5/day each:** :ref:`srd:calm-emotions`, *dissonant whispers*, *ray of sickness*,
:ref:`srd:hideous-laughter`

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:confusion`, :ref:`srd:invisibility`

**Forgetful Spellcasting.** When a creature fails an Intelligence,
Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw against a spell cast by an
alehouse drake, the creature immediately forgets the source of
the spellcasting.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.

**Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6).** An alehouse drake can burp a
cloud of intoxicating gas in a 15-foot cone. A creature caught
in the cloud becomes :ref:`srd:poisoned` for 1 minute and must make a
successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become :ref:`srd:stunned`
for 1d6 rounds.

**Discombobulating Touch.** An alehouse drake can make a touch
attack that grants its target +3 to Dexterity-based skill checks
and melee attacks but also induces :ref:`srd:confusion` as per the spell.
This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 13 Charisma
saving throw negates this effect.
