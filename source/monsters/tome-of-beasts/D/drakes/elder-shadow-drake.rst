Drake, Elder Shadow
-------------------

*A large dragon-like creature with black scales and shadowy wings
emerges suddenly from the darkness. Its red eyes glare bright as
coals, and it speaks in a deep monotone.*

**Strange Humor.** Elder shadow drakes are mischievous and
greedy. They devour entire goats and sheep and sometimes
spell out messages with their bones. They make surprisingly
good bandits, and sometimes ally themselves with bands of
humanoids—their own share of plunder must always be clearly
the largest share of any such arrangement.

**Solitary Lairs.** They haunt dark and lonely places, such as
deep caves, dense forests, and shadowy ruins. They are long-lived
for drakes, often reaching 250 years of age, and mate rarely,
abandoning their eggs shortly before hatching.

**Fade Into Shadows.** An elder shadow drake naturally fades
from view in areas of dim light or darkness. Darkvision doesn’t
overcome this, because the shadow drake doesn’t simply blend
into shadows; it magically becomes invisible in them.

**Shadow Blend.** In areas of dim light or
darkness, an elder shadow drake
is treated as invisible. Artificial
illumination, such as a lantern or
a light or continual flame
spell, does not negate this
ability; nothing less than
true sunlight or a daylight
spell does. The drake
cannot use its Speed
Surge or its Stygian
Breath while invisible. An
elder shadow drake can
suspend or resume this ability
at will, so long as the drake is
in dim light or darkness.

**Shadow Jump (3/Day).** An elder shadow drake can travel
between shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell. This
magical transport must begin and end in an area of dim light or
darkness, and the distance must be no more than 60 feet.

**Speed Surge (3/Day).** The elder shadow drake takes one
additional move action on its turn. It can use only one speed
surge per round.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The drake makes one bite attack and one tail slap
attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage.

**Tail Slap.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**Stygian Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The elder shadow drake
exhales a ball of black liquid that travels up to 60 feet before
exploding into a cloud of frigid black mist with a 20-foot radius.
Each creature in that sphere takes 42 (12d6) cold damage, or
half damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw.
Within the area of effect, the mist snuffs out nonmagical light
sources and dispels magical light of 1st level or lower.
