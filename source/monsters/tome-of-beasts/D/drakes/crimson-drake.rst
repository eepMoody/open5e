Drake, Crimson
--------------

*Crimson drakes are easy to spot, with scales the color of dried blood,
a deadly scorpion stinger, and a mischievous gleam in their eyes.*

**Fiery Raiders.** Crimson drakes lair in woodlands near small
settlements, making nighttime forays to set fires and hunt those
who flee the flames—traits that make humanoid tribes prize
them as raiding partners. Goblins gleefully adopt a crimson
drake as a mascot to burn things down while they get on with
slaughtering people. Red dragons and flame dragons regard a
crimson drake as a pet, at best, but this rarely works out. When
it is inevitably insulted by its larger cousins, a malicious crimson
drake may even intentionally
set fires to blaze a trail for
hunters to the dragon’s lair.

**Mistaken for Pseudodragons.**
A crimson drake’s scales and features are
quite similar to those of a pseudodragon,
and they will imitate a pseudodragon’s
hunting cry or song to trick
victims into approaching.
Once their prey gets close
enough, they immolate it.

As with pseudodragons, they resemble a red
dragon in all but size and the presence of the
drake’s scorpion-like stinger. On average, a
crimson drake weighs 12 lb, its body measures
about 18 inches long, and its tail adds
another 18 inches.

**Foul Familiars.** A crimson drake occasionally
chooses to serve an evil spellcaster as a familiar; they are
too mischievous to be loyal or trustworthy, but ferocious in
defense of their master.

*Hit:* 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed
on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for
1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target takes
