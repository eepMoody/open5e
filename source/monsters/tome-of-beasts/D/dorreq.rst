Dorreq
------

*These twitching balls of tentacles surround an
inhuman face dominated by a squid-like beak.*

**Servants of the Void.** The dorreqi are
servants to ancient horrors of the void and
realms beyond human understanding. They
are guardians and sentries for such creatures, and they
swarm and attack any creatures approaching too close to
the elder aberrations they serve.

**Death from Above.** Dorreq prefer to drop on their
victims from above, pinning them in a grapple attack
with their many tentacles and biting them with their large
chitinous beaks.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The dorreq’s innate spellcasting ability
is Intelligence (spell save DC 10). It can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no material components:

**3/day each:** blink, dimension door, haste, shatter

**Wasteland Stride.** This ability works like tree stride, but the
dorreq can use it to sink into and appear out of any sandy or
rocky ground, and the range is only 30 ft. Using this ability
replaces the dorreq’s usual movement.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dorreq makes two tentacle attacks and one
bite attack. If both tentacle attacks hit, the target is grappled
(escape DC 14).

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit,
reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (4d8 + 4)
piercing damage.

**Tentacle.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If both tentacles
hit the same target in a single turn, the target is grappled
(escape DC 14) and pulled within reach of the bite attack, if
it was farther than 5 feet away. The target must be size Large
or smaller to be pulled this way. The dorreq can maintain a
grapple on one Large, two Medium, or two Small creatures at
one time.

**Entanglement.** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of
a dorreq must make a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw
each round or be restrained by the dorreq’s tentacles until
the start of its next turn. On its turn, the dorreq can ignore or
freely release a creature in the affected area.
