Dau
---

*A constant shimmer surrounds this short, winged creature, and
staring at it is eyewatering and confusing, like a distant desert
mirage though it’s only scant yards away.*

**Desert Mirage Fey.** Daus are creatures of haze and illusion.
They stand three feet tall, with sandy skin, and are surrounded
by a shimmering aura like a heat haze. They are flighty, physically
weak, and unfocused, but are agile in both body and wit.

**Lazy and Bored.** Their ability to magically provide for
themselves in most material ways tends to make daus lazy and
hedonistic. As a result, daus are often friendly and eager for
company and they invite friends and strangers alike to rest in
their lairs, partake in their feasts and share their stories.

**Sticklers for Etiquette.** However, a dau’s hospitality often
turns to cruelty when guests breach its intricate rules of etiquette.

**Magic Resistance.** The dau has advantage on saving throws

**Innate Spellcasting.** The dau’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:detect-thoughts`

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:invisibility`, :ref:`srd:mirror-image`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:mirage-arcane`, :ref:`srd:programmed-illusion`, :ref:`srd:project-image`

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack:** The dau makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6)
necrotic damage, and the dau regains hit points equal to the
necrotic damage dealt. The target must succeed on a DC 13
Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced
by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This
reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest.

**Tangible Illusion (1/Day).** After casting an illusion spell of
an object, the dau temporarily transforms that illusion into a
physical, nonmagical object. The temporary object lasts 10
minutes, after which it reverts to being an illusion (or vanishes,
if the duration of the original illusion expires). During that
time, the illusion has all the physical properties of the object it
represents, but not magical properties. The dau must touch the
illusion to trigger this transformation, and the object can be no
larger than 5 cubic feet.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Mirror Dodge (1/Day).** When the dau would be hit by an
attack or affected by a spell, the dau replaces itself with an
illusory duplicate and teleports to any unoccupied space
within 30 feet in sight. The dau isn’t affected and the illusory
duplicate is destroyed.
