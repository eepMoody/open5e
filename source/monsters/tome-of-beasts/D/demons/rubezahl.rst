Rubezahl
--------

*Resembling a black-furred stag that walks like a man, this creature
has a pair of immense, branching antlers arching above its coldly
gleaming eyes. The fur is sleek over most of its body, but becomes
shaggy around its goatlike legs. The creature’s hands are tipped
with wicked claws, and its legs are goatlike with cloven hooves.*

**Assume Mortal Form.** Rubezahls are capricious creatures,
driven by constantly shifting motivations and mannerisms.
They are consummate tricksters who delight in taking the
form of innocuous mortals like traveling monks, tinkers, or
lost merchants. They love to play the friend with their nearly
undetectable lies, slipping into the confidence of unsuspecting
mortals before murdering them.

**Counting Demons.** Rubezahls have a weakness, however.
They are known as counting demons, and a savvy mortal who
knows its nature can confound one with groups of objects: a
handful of coins, a basket of apples, even a bed of flowers. If
the objects are clearly pointed out to the rubezahl, the creature
becomes distracted until it counts each item in the group.
Unfortunately for mortals, rebezahls can count startlingly fast;
even a mound of gravel takes no more than a few moments
for a rubezahl to assess. Rubezahl loathe being compelled this
way, and they are equally driven to annihilate any mortal bold
enough to exploit this weakness.

**Counting Compulsion.** If a creature uses an action to point
out an ordered group of objects to the rubezahl, the demon is
compelled to count the entire group. Until the end of its next
turn, the rubezahl has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability
checks and it can’t take reactions. Once it has counted a given
group of objects, it can’t be compelled to count those objects
ever again.

**False Tongue.** The rubezahl has advantage on Charisma
(Deception) checks, and magical attempts to discern lies
always report that the rubezahl’s words are true.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The rubezahl’s innate spellcasting ability
is Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It
can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material
components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:disguise-self` (humanoid forms only), :ref:`srd:fog-cloud`

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:call-lightning`, :ref:`srd:gust-of-wind`, :ref:`srd:lightning-bolt`

**1/day:** :ref:`srd:control-weather`

**Sneak Attack (1/turn).** The rubezahl does an extra 10 (3d6)
damage if it hits a target with a weapon attack when it had
advantage on the attack roll, or if the target is within 5 feet of
an ally of the rubezahl that isn’t incapacitated and the rubezahl
doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The rubezahl makes one gore attack and two claw
attacks.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage.

**Gore.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 18 (3d8 + 5) piercing damage and a target creature must
succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked
:ref:`srd:prone`.

**Thunderstrike (Recharge 5-6).** The rubezahl calls a sizzling bolt
of lightning out of the sky, or from the air if underground or
indoors, to strike a point the rubezahl can see within 150 feet.
All creatures within 20 feet of the target point take 36 (8d8)
lightning damage, or half damage with a successful DC 16
Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails its saving throw is
:ref:`srd:stunned` until the start of the rubezahl’s next turn.
