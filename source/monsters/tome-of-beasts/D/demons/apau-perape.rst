Demon, Apau Perape
------------------

*Sharp teeth fill this large, demonic ape’s mouth. Its long, muscular
arms stretch to the ground, ending in wickedly curved claws.*

**Servants of Fire.** These black-furred gorilla demons serve
only Mechuiti, the demon lord of fire and apes. Their final loyalty
is unshakable, though sometimes they serve others for a time—
and they have no fear of fire, gleefully setting fire to villages and
crops if their master is snubbed or insulted.

**Fearless Attackers.** The apau perape are fearless and savage,
living for battle. Once in combat, their morale never breaks. Like
their master, they have an insatiable hunger and do not leave any
dead behind, consuming even their bones.

**Eyes of Fire.** When this demon is angered, its eyes glow a
deep, disturbing red, unlike any natural ape.

**Diseased Ichor.** Every time the apau perape takes piercing or
slashing damage, a spray of caustic blood spurts from the
wound toward the attacker. This spray forms a line 10 feet
long and 5 feet wide. The first creature in the line must make
a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease
or be infected by Mechuiti’s Ichor disease. The creature is
poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that
elapse, the target must repeat the Constitution saving throw
or reduce its hit point maximum by 5 (2d4). The disease is
cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its
hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target’s hit point
maximum lasts until the disease is cured.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The apau perape is an innate spellcaster.
Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). The apau
perape can innately cast the following spells, requiring no
material components:

**1/day each:** fear, wall of fire

**Magic Resistance.** The apau perape has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.
