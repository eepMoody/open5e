Domovoi
-------

*The domovoi enjoy violence and bonebreaking; this makes them
useful to more delicate creatures that need enforers.*

**Long Armed Bruisers.** Domovoi resemble nothing so much
as large, stony goblins, with oversized heads and leering grins,
and with mossy beards as well as massive shoulders and forearms.
Their large limbs give them reach and powerful slam attacks.

**Abandoned Servants.** The domovoi were the portal guards
and house lackeys of the elvish nobility, and some were left
behind—some say on purpose.

**Debt Collectors.** These smirking stragglers seek work
as tireless sentinels and fey button men, collecting debts for
criminal syndicates. They can use alter self and invisibility at will,
and they delight in frustrating the progress of would-be thieves
and tomb robbers. They enjoy roughing up weaker creatures
with their powerful, stony fists.
