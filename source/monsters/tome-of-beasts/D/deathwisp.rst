Deathwisp
---------

*A shadowy figure flickers in and out of view. Its indistinct shape
betrays a sylvan ancestry, and its eyes are malevolent blue points
of light.*

**Fey Undead.** A deathwisp is a wraith-like spirit created in the
Shadow Realm from the violent death of a shadow fey or evil fey.

**Rift Walkers.** Many deathwisps remain among the shadows,
but a few enter the natural world through planar rifts and gates,
or by walking along shadow roads between the worlds.
Retaining only a trace of their former personality and
knowledge, their lost kindness has been replaced with malice.

**Devour Breath.** A deathwisp feasts on the breath of living
things, and invariably seeks to devour animals and solitary
intelligent prey. It is quite intelligent and avoids fights against
greater numbers.

**Undead Nature.** A deathwisp doesn’t require air, food, drink,
or sleep

**Flicker.** The deathwisp flickers in and out of sight,
and ranged weapon attacks against it are made
with disadvantage.

**Incorporeal Movement.** The deathwisp can move
through other creatures and objects as if they were
difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it
ends its turn inside a solid object.

**Shadow Jump.** A deathwisp can travel between shadows
as if by means of dimension door. This magical transport
must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow.
A shadow fey can jump up to a total of 40 feet per day; this
may be a single jump of 40 feet, four jumps of 10 feet each,
etc. This ability must be used in 10-foot increments.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the deathwisp
has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on sight.

**Unnatural Aura.** Animals do not willingly approach within 30
feet of a deathwisp, unless a master makes a successful DC 15
Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Life Drain.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 36 (7d8 + 5) necrotic damage. The target must
succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point
maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage
taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long
rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point
maximum to 0.

**Create Deathwisp.** The deathwisp targets a
humanoid within 10 feet of it that died violently
less than 1 minute ago. The target’s spirit rises
as a wraith in the space of its corpse or in
the nearest unoccupied space. This wraith
is under the deathwisp’s control. The
deathwisp can keep no more than
five wraiths under its control at
one time.
