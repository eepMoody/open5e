Devil, Automata
---------------

*A nightmare wrapped in chains and built of cutting cogs and
whirring gears, an automata devil howls like a hurricane in
battle. Once chain devils, automata devils have been promoted to
greater power.*

**Guards and Overseers.** Sometimes called castigas, automata
devils are made to monitor others. They are often put in charge
of prisoners or infernal factories.

**Pierced by Chain and Wire.** This slender creature’s skin
is pierced with barbs, sharp nails, and coils of wire, which have
been threaded through its flesh. Chains are buried under blisters
and scabs. This infernal horror’s eyelids—both front and back
pairs—have been sewn back with wire, while six arms ending in
large grasping hands erupt from its shoulders.

**Coiled Metal Whips.** The creature’s back is broad and
massive. Its head is a black mass ending in two large mandibles.
By its side, it carries a huge coiled whip that squirms like a snake
and is said to scent lies and treachery. The creature’s stomach
opens up like a second mouth, filled with spines.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The automata devil makes two melee attacks,
using any combination of bite, claw, and whip attacks. The bite
attack can be used only once per turn.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 18 (2d10 + 7) slashing damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.

**Whip.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 11 (1d8 + 7) slashing damage and the target is
grappled (escape DC 17) and restrained. Only two targets
can be grappled by the automata devil at one time, and each
grappled target prevents one whip from being used to attack.
An individual target can be grappled by only one whip at
a time. A grappled target takes 9 (2d8) piercing
damage at the start of its turn.

**Punishing Maw.** If a target is already grappled
in a whip at the start of the automata devil’s
turn, both creatures make opposed Strength
(Athletics) checks. If the grappled creature
wins, it takes 9 (2d8) piercing damage and
remains grappled. If the devil wins, the grappled creature is
dragged into the devil’s stomach maw, a mass of churning
gears, razor teeth, and whirling blades. The creature takes 49
(4d20 + 7) slashing damage and is grappled, and the whip
is free to attack again on the devil’s next turn. The creature
takes another 49 (4d20 +7) slashing damage automatically
at the start of each of the automata devil’s turns for as long
as it remains grappled in the maw. Only one creature can be
grappled in the punishing maw at a time. The automata devil
can freely “spit out” a creature or corpse during its turn, to free
up the maw for another victim.

**Fear Aura.** Automata devils radiate fear in a 10-foot radius. A
creature that starts its turn in the affected area must make a
successful DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened.
A creature that makes the save successfully cannot be affected
by the same automata devil’s fear aura again.
