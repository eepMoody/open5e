Devil, Chort
------------

*Small horns crown this pig-faced devil’s head. It stands on shaggy
goat legs and holds a flaming polearm in its clawed hands. It bears
a wicked gleam in its black eyes.*

**Bad Bargains.** Quick and canny, a chort devil uses varied,
pleasing forms to entice mortals to make terrible bargains, but
it revels in its obvious devilishness. A chort wants its victim to
know it is dealing with a devil. The relative straightforwardness
of this approach enables the creature to better deceive those
whom it bargains with. After all, the chort affirms, if the victim
weren’t so desperate, he wouldn’t be bargaining with a devil.
If necessary, an implied threat of immolation gives it greater
bargaining power, but the creature is careful not to torture or
otherwise harm its patsy, since that voids any potential contract.

**Recitation of Contracts.** An annual spectacle in large
cities involves some poor fool who believes he can trick a
chort and escape a legal bargain. The devil appears and
recites the entirety of the contract its victim signed, replete
with embarrassing details about a dispatched rival, the
ensnarement of a love who once spurned him, and other
disclosures. A chort ensures all those entangled in its
victim’s affairs are present to hear it, and it disappears
once all the victim's dark secrets have been revealed.

**Smear Tactics.** A zealous opponent of the chort
often finds himself the victim of his own hubris, as
the devil digs up or creates vile tales about its foe
and brings his folly to light. A chort enjoys tarnishing
the reputation of tools of good. For example, it may
steal a paladin’s sword and use it to murder an especially
pious person, leaving the sword in the victim. Thus, a chort
dispatches a foe strongly resistant to its manipulations, brings
suspicion to another potential foe, and taints a weapon—at least
in reputation—which might be used against it.
