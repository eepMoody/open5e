Devil, Lunar
------------

*A hulking figure floats in the air, a winged horror
painted in mist and moonlight.*

**Corruptors of the Moon.** Always
standing a bit apart from the
machinations of the Dukes of Hell due
to their dependence on moonlight, lunar
devils can be found subverting druidical
orders or leading packs of werewolves.
They are a lazy breed of devil, and prefer
lounging in the light of the moon over any
more vigorous activity. The only exception
is an opportunity to corrupt druids
and moon-worshippers, pitting them
against followers of sun gods.

**Vain and Boastful.** Lunar devils are
as vain as they are indolent, and tales the
fey tell of them involve thwarting them
by appealing to their vanity. Lunar devils
frequently befriend the dark fey.

**Flying in Darkness.** In combat, lunar
devils sometimes cast fly on allies to bring
them along, and they stay in areas of
moonlight whenever they can. Lunar devils
have excellent vision in total darkness
as well, though, and are happy to use
that against foes. At range, they use
hurl moonlight and lightwalking to
frustrate enemies. In melee, they use
wall of ice to split foes, the better to battle
just half at a time.

**Devil’s Sight.** Magical darkness doesn’t impede the devil’s
darkvision.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The devil’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** fly, major image, planar binding

**3/day:** greater invisibility

**1/day:** wall of ice

**Light Incorporeality.** The devil is semi-incorporeal when
standing in moonlight, and is immune to all nonmagical
attacks in such conditions. Even when hit by spells or magic
weapons, it takes only half damage from a corporeal source,
with the exception of force damage. Holy water can affect the
devil as it does incorporeal undead.

**Lightwalking.** Once per round, the lunar devil magically
teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying,
from one beam of moonlight to another within 80 feet. This
relocation uses half of its speed.

**Magic Resistance.** The devil has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.
