Devil, Gilded
-------------

*This tall, bronze-complexioned man is abnormally long-limbed
and clad in armor of stained and battered coins. His wiry frame
is festooned with mismatched bracelets, rings, and necklaces, each
gaudier than the last. The easy smile on his face is cold with envy.*

**Servants of Mammon.** Rarely seen in their natural form
outside of Hell, gilded devils are the servitors of Mammon,
archdevil of greed. They tempt and corrupt with promises
of wealth, power, and fame, twisting mortal greed into sure
damnation.

**Impression of Wisdom.** When pursuing a mortal of high
standing, gilded devils prefer unassuming appearances, molding
their flesh and gaudy trappings to make themselves look the
parts of wise advisers, canny merchants, or sly confidants.

**Fond of Gold and Jewels.** Even in their humblest form,
gilded devils always wear a piece of golden jewelry or a jeweled
button or ornament.

**Liar’s Largesse.** A gilded devil has influence over the

saving throws against the gilded devil’s abilities

advantage on saving throws against

weapon attacks are magical.

Wisdom (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The
gilded devil can innately cast the following spells, requiring no
material components:

**At will:** detect thoughts, major image, suggestion

**3/day each:** dominate person, polymorph, scorching ray (4 rays),
scrying

**1/day:** teleport (self plus 50 lb. of objects only)

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The gilded devil makes two heavy flail attacks.

**Heavy Flail (Scourge of Avarice).** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8
to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) bludgeoning
damage.

**Betrayal of Riches (Recharge 5-6).** As a bonus action, a gilded
devil can turn rings, necklaces, and other jewelry momentarily
against their wearer. The devil can affect any visible item of
jewelry on up to two creatures within 60 feet, twisting them into
cruel barbs and spikes. Each target must succeed on a DC 15
Wisdom saving throw to halve the damage from this effect. If
the saving throw fails, the victim takes 13 (3d8) piercing damage
and an additional effect based on the item location targeted.

======== ==========================================
Location Effect
Arms     Melee damage halved until short rest
Hand     Drop any held item
Eyes     Permanently blinded
Head     Disadvantage on Int checks until long rest
Feet     Speed halved for 24 hours
Neck     Stunned, unable to breathe for 1 round
Other    No additional effect
======== ==========================================

An item is treated as jewelry if it is made of a precious material
(such as silver, gold, ivory, or adamantine), adorned with gems,
or both, and is worth at least 100 gp.

**Scorn Base Metals.** A gilded devil’s attacks ignore any
protection provided by nonmagical armor made of bronze,
iron, steel, or similar metals. Protection provided by valuable
metals such as adamantine, mithral, and gold apply, as do
bonuses provided by non-metallic objects.

**Scourge of Avarice.** As a bonus action, a gilded devil wearing
jewelry worth at least 1,000 gp can reshape it into a +2 heavy
flail. A creature struck by this jeweled flail suffers disadvantage
on all Wisdom saving throws until his or her next short rest, in
addition to normal weapon damage. The flail reverts to its base
components 1 minute after it leaves the devil’s grasp, or upon
the gilded devil’s death.

**Voracious Greed.** As an action, a gilded devil can consume non-magical
jewelry or coinage worth up to 1,000 gp. For each 200
gp consumed, it heals 5 hp of damage. A gilded devil can use
this ability against the worn items of a grappled foe. The target
must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw to keep an
item from being consumed.
