Devil, Crystalline
------------------

*Created and favored by Mammon, the arch-devil of greed,
crystalline devils masquerade as magic treasures.*

**Barefoot, Gem-Coated.** Crystalline devils resemble
gem‑coated humanoids with cruel, twisted faces, jagged teeth,
and terrible talons like shards of broken glass. Their feet,
however, are soft and bare, allowing them to pad along with
surprising stealth, always looking for a favorable spot to assume
gem form

**Winking Jewels.** In its treasure form, a crystalline devil
resembles a pretty, sparkling jewel lying on the ground, glowing
with a warm inner light. They seek to catch the eye of an unwary
creature whose mind it might corrupt to greed and murder. If
their identity is discovered in gem form, they reassume their
normal form and attack.

**Passed Along.** After insinuating themselves into groups, they
encourage betrayal and murder, then persuade a host to pass on
their treasure as atonement for their crimes.
