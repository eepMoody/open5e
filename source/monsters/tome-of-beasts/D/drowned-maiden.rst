Drowned Maiden
--------------

*The drowned maiden is usually found as the corpse of a women
floating in the water, her long hair drifting with the current.
Occasionally, these are drowned lads rather than maidens, though
this is rare.*

**Raging Romantics.** Drowned maidens are piteous but
terrifying undead, created when a woman dies in water due to
a doomed romance, whether from unrequited love or whether
drowned by a philandering partner. Either way, the drowned
maiden awakens from death seeking vengeance. Even as she
dishes out retribution, a drowned maiden often anguishes over
her doomed existence and tragic fate.

**Beckoning for Help.** The maiden lurks in the silent depths
where she died—usually deserted docks, bridges, or coastal
cliffs. She waits to pull the living to the same watery grave in
which she is now condemned. A drowned maiden uses her
disguise self ability to appear as in life. She silently beckons
victims from afar, as if in danger of drowning. When within
range, the maiden uses her hair to pull her victim close enough
to kiss it. Victims soon weaken and drown. The victim’s final
vision is the drowned maiden’s tearful lament over the loss of
life.

**Death to Betrayers.** Desperate individuals may bargain with
drowned maidens, and they will release pleading victims who
promise to return to their lair with the person who caused the
maiden’s death. Embracing and drowning her betrayer releases
the maiden from undeath.
