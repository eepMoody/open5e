Nihilethic Zombie
-----------------

Created by the diseased will of :ref:`nihileths <tob:nihilith>`, these zombies do
their creator’s bidding without fear or hesitation. While their
appearance differs from typical zombies, they too move with the
same jerky motions and uneven gait as their undead brethren.
The skin and flesh of nihileth zombies is translucent and
slimy. They are adept swimmers, and they have no difficulty
functioning on dry land, always in service to their masters.

**Undead Nature.** A nihilethic zombie doesn't require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP)

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces
the nihileth to 0 hit points, it must
make a Constitution saving throw
with a DC of 5 + the damage taken,
unless the damage is radiant or from
a critical hit. On a success, the nihileth
drops to 1 hit point instead.

**Dual State:** Like its nihileth creator, a
nihilethic zombie can assume either
a material or ethereal form. When in
its material form, it has resistance to
nonmagical weapons. In its ethereal
form, it is immune to nonmagical
weapons. Its ethereal form appears as
a dark purple outline of its material
form, with a blackish-purple haze
within.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Slam (Material Form Only):** *Melee
Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d6 + 1)
bludgeoning damage and the
target must make a successful DC 13
Constitution saving throw or become
diseased. The disease has little effect for 1
minute; during that time, it can be removed
by :ref:`srd:bless`, :ref:`srd:lesser-restoration`, or comparable
magic. After 1 minute, the diseased creature’s skin
becomes translucent and slimy. The creature cannot
regain hit points unless it is at least partially underwater, and
the disease can only be removed by :ref:`srd:heal` or comparable magic.
Unless the creature is either fully submerged or frequently
doused with water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10
minutes. If a creature dies while diseased, it rises in 2d6 rounds
as a nihilethic zombie. This zombie is permanently dominated
by the nihileth that commands the attacking zombie.

**Withering Touch (Ethereal Form):** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d6 + 1) necrotic damage.

**Form Swap:** As a bonus action, the nihilethic zombie can alter
between its material and ethereal forms at will.

**Sacrifice Life.** A nihilethic zombie can sacrifice itself to heal
a nihileth within 30 feet of it. All of its remaining hit points
transfer to the nihileth in the form of healing. The nihilethic
zombie is reduced to 0 hit points and it doesn’t make an
Undead Fortitude saving throw. A nihileth cannot be healed
above its maximum hit points in this manner.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Void Body:** The nihilethic zombie can reduce the damage it
takes from a single source by 1d12 points. This reduction
cannot be applied to radiant damage.
