Nihileth
--------

*Eons ago, a group of aboleth left the Material Plane to wander
through distant planes—seeing them through magical scrying was
not enough, so these aboleth used astral magic and bodily travel to
see far beyond normal realms.*

**A Forgotten Tribe.** As ages passed, memories of those who
departed slowly faded from the minds of those aboleth who
remained behind. Those few aboleth who did remember that
long ago some of their kin had gone plane-wandering assumed
that the wanderers must have died in distant hells or paradises.

**Changed by Planar Wandering.** The plane-wanderers
hadn’t died. Instead, their eons-long exposure to alien
realms and to the space between changed them, restructuring
their life force and making them into something even more
nightmarish—but better able to withstand both strange hells
and golden realms of eldritch delight.

**Servants of the Void.** They returned even more corrupt
and powerful than they had left, and these wandering nihileths
returned to the mortal world intent on spreading the influence
of the Void and the utter evil they found in the vast darkness
between worlds.

**Undead Nature.** A nihileth does not require air, food, drink,
or sleep.

**Languages** Void Speech, telepathy 120 ft.

**Challenge** 12 (8,400 XP)

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the nihileth to 0 hit points,
it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the
damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical
hit. On a success, the nihileth drops to 1 hit point instead.

**Dual State.** A nihileth exists upon the Material Plane in one of
two forms and can switch between them at will. In its material
form, it has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons.
In its ethereal form, it is immune to damage from nonmagical
weapons. The creature’s ethereal form appears as a dark purple
outline of its material form, with a blackish-purple haze within.
A nihileth in ethereal form can move through air as though it
were water, with a fly speed of 40 feet.

**Void Aura.** The undead nihileth is surrounded by a chilling
cloud. A living creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of a
nihileth must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving
throw or be slowed until the start of its next turn. In addition,
any creature that has been diseased by a nihileth or a :ref:`tob:nihilethic-zombie`
takes 7 (2d6) cold damage every time it starts its turn
within the aura.

**Infecting Telepathy.** If a creature communicates telepathically
with the nihileth, or uses a psychic attack against it, the nihileth
can spread its disease to the creature. The creature must
succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom save or become infected with the
same disease caused by the nihileth’s tentacle attack.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack:** The nihileth makes three tentacle attacks or three
withering touches, depending on what form it is in.

**Tentacle (Material Form Only):** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to
hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning
damage. If the target creature is hit, it must make a successful
DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The
disease has no effect for 1 minute; during that time, it can be
removed by :ref:`srd:lesser-restoration` or comparable magic. After 1
minute, the diseased creature’s skin becomes translucent and
slimy. The creature cannot regain hit points unless it is entirely
underwater, and the disease can only be removed by :ref:`srd:heal` or
comparable magic. Unless the creature is fully submerged or
frequently doused with water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage
every 10 minutes. If a creature dies while diseased, it rises in
1d6 rounds as a :ref:`tob:nihilethic-zombie`. This zombie is permanently
dominated by the nihileth.

**Withering Touch (Ethereal Form Only):** *Melee Weapon Attack:*
+8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 14 (3d6+4) necrotic
damage.

**Form Swap:** As a bonus action, the nihileth can alter between
its material and ethereal forms at will.

**Tail (Material Form Only):** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit,
reach 10 ft. one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

**Enslave (3/day):** The nihileth targets one creature it can see
within 30 ft. of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom
saving throw or be magically :ref:`srd:charmed` by the nihileth until the
nihileth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from
the target. The charmed target is under the nihileth’s control
and can't take reactions, and the nihileth and the target can
communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.

Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target
can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No
more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the
saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the nihileth.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Void Body:** The nihileth can reduce the damage it takes from a
single source to 0. Radiant damage can only be reduced by half.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A nihileth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a
time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The nihileth
regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect.** The aboleth makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Swipe.** The aboleth makes one tail attack.

**Psychic Drain (Costs 2 Actions).** One creature charmed by
the aboleth takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the aboleth
regains hit points equal to the damage the creature takes.

A Nihileth’s Lair
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While aboleths create their lairs underwater, spending most of
their time submerged, a nihileth lair can be encountered out of
the water, often in a cave or a ruined, abandoned city.

Lair Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the nihileth can
take a lair action to create one of the magical effects as per an
aboleth, or the void absorbance action listed below. The nihileth
cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row.

* Void absorbance. A nihileth can pull the life force from those it
  has converted to :ref:`nihilethic zombies <tob:nihilethic-zombie>` to replenish its own life.
  This takes 18 (6d6) hit points from zombies within 30 feet of
  the nihileth, spread evenly between the zombies, and healing
  the nihileth. If a zombie reaches 0 hit points from this action,
  it perishes with no Undead Fortitude saving throw.

Regional Effects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The regional effects of a nihileth’s lair are the same as that of an
aboleth, except as following.

* Water sources within 1 mile of a nihileth’s lair are not only
  supernaturally fouled but can spread the disease of the
  nihileth. A creature who drinks from such water must make a
  successful DC 14 Constitution check or become infected.
