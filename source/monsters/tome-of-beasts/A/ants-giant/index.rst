Ants, Giant
-----------

*Several pony-sized ants swarm around an ant the size of a draft horse,
clacking their serrated mandibles and threatening with their stingers.*

Giant ants look much like a normal ant with six legs, a waspish
segmented body, and large antenna. Their hides are covered in
thick chitin, and they have large, serrated mandibles flanking
their mouths and stingers on their tails. These stingers are
the size of a shortsword, and theyâ€™re capable of stabbing and
poisoning a human to death.

**Colony Defenders.** Giant ants form colonies under the
control of a queen much like their normal-sized cousins.
Sterile females form castes with the workers building the nest
and caring for larvae. Queens and male drones rarely leave
the colony. Soldiers defend the colony and forage for food.

**Carry Prey Home.** Giant ants are both predators and
scavengers, working in organized groups to bring down
large prey and carry it back to the nest. Giant ants
tend to ignore animals away from the colony when not
foraging for food, but they quickly move to overwhelm
prey when hungry or threatened.

A giant ant stands nearly four feet tall and weighs
400 pounds, while a giant ant queen is over five
feet tall and weighs 900 pounds. Giant ants
communicate with each other primarily with
pheromones but also use sound and touch.
