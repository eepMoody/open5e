Amphiptere
----------

*The amphiptere is most commonly found as a flight of gold-crested,
bat-winged serpents bursting from the foliage.*

**Tiny Wyverns.** An amphiptere has batlike wings and a stinger
similar to a wyvern’s at the end of its tail. Their reptilian bodies
are scaly, but their wings sprout greenish-yellow feathers.

**Swooping and Swift.** They are surprisingly maneuverable in
spite of their size, able to change direction suddenly and make
deadly hit-and-run strikes. They swoop in and out of combat,
snapping at targets with their needlelike teeth and striking with
their envenomed stingers. Once a foe is poisoned and injured,
they hover closer in a tightly packed, flapping mass of fangs,
battering wings, and jabbing stingers.

**Strength in Flocks.** Despite their fighting ability,
amphipteres are not particularly brave. Most often, they tend to
lurk in small flocks in dense foliage, where they can burst forth
in a flurry of wings when prey comes within view. They display
surprising cunning and tenacity in large groups; they may harass
foes for minutes or hours before closing in for the kill.
