Algorith
--------

*Sometimes called folding angels, algoriths are lawful beings made
from sheer force, pure math, and universal physical laws.*

**Creatures of Pure Reason.** They are the border guards of
the Conceptual Realms, warding subjective beings from the

**Realms of the Absolute.** Eternal, remorseless, and unceasingly
vigilant, they guard against the monstrosities that lurk in
the multiverse’s most obscure dimensions, and seek out and
eliminate chaos even from the abodes of the gods.

**Foes of Chaos.** They visit mortal realms when chaos threatens
to unravel a location, or when the skeins of fate are tangled. On
some occasions, an algorith will serve a god of Law or answer the
summons of a skein witch.

Algoriths fight with conjured blades of force, and they can
also summon universal energy that deconstructs randomness,
weakening enemies or reducing them to finely ordered
crystalline dust.

**Social but Mysterious.** In groups, they move and fight in
silent coordination. Only tiny variations in the formulas etched
into their skins identify one algorith from another. Five is a
number of extreme importance to all algoriths, but few are
willing (or able) to explain why to anyone who isn’t an algorith.
Algoriths may have castes, ranks, or commanders, but no mortal
has decoded the mathematical blazons adorning their flesh. The
algoriths themselves refuse to discuss these formulas with those
who do not comprehend them.

**Constructed Nature.** An algorith doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

**Languages** Common, Celestial, Draconic, Infernal

**Immutable Form.** The algorith is immune to any spell
or effect that would alter its form.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The algorith’s innate spellcasting
ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast
the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** aid, blur, detect magic, dimension door

**5/day each:** dispel magic

**1/day:** commune (5 questions), wall of force

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The algorith makes two logic razor attacks.

**Logic Razor.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 31 (4d12 + 5) force damage.

**Cone of Negation (Recharge 5-6).** An algorith can project a
cone of null energy. Targets inside the 30 foot cone take 42
(12d6) force damage and suffer the effect of a dispel magic spell.
A successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage to
half and negates the dispel magic effect on that target.

**Reality Bomb (5/Day).** The algorith can summon forth a tiny
rune of law and throw it as a weapon. Any creature within 30
feet of the square where the reality bomb lands takes 21 (6d6)
force damage and is stunned until the start of the algorith’s
next turn. A target that makes a successful DC 16 Dexterity
saving throw takes half damage and isn’t stunned.
