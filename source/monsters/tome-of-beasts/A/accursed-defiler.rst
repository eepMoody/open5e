Accursed Defiler
----------------

*A gaunt figure in a tattered black mantle shrouded in a cloud of
whirling sand. Thin cracks run across its papyrus-dry skin and
around its hollow, black eyes.*

**Cursed to Wander and Thirst.** Accursed defilers are the
remnants of an ancient tribe that desecrated a sacred oasis.
For their crime, the wrathful spirits cursed the tribe to forever
wander the wastes attempting to quench an insatiable thirst.
Each defiler carries a parched sandstorm within its lungs and in
the flowing sand in its veins. Wherever they roam, they leave only
the desiccated husks of their victims littering the sand.

**Unceasing Hatred.** The desperate or foolish sometimes
try to speak with these ill-fated creatures in their
archaic native tongue, to learn their secrets or to
bargain for their services, but a defiler’s heart is blackened
with hate and despair, leaving room for naught but woe.

**Servants to Great Evil.** On very rare occasions, accursed
defilers serve evil high priests, fext, or soulsworn warlocks
as bodyguards and zealous destroyers, eager to spread the
withering desert’s hand to new lands.

**Undead Nature.** An accursed defiler doesn’t require air,
food, drink, or sleep.

**Cursed Existence.** When it drops to 0 hit points in desert
terrain, the accursed defiler’s body disintegrates into sand
and a sudden parched breeze. However, unless it was killed
in a hallowed location, with radiant damage, or by a blessed
creature, the accursed defiler reforms at the next sundown
1d100 miles away in a random direction.

**Sand Shroud.** A miniature sandstorm constantly whirls around
the accursed defiler in a 10-foot radius. This area is lightly
obscured to creatures other than an accursed defiler. Wisdom
(Survival) checks made to follow tracks left by an accursed
defiler or other creatures that were traveling in its sand shroud
are made with disadvantage.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The accursed defiler makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If a creature is hit by
this attack twice in the same round (from the same or different
accursed defilers), the target must make a DC 13 Constitution
saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.

**Sandslash (Recharge 5-6).** As an action, the accursed defiler
intensifies the vortex of sand that surrounds it. All creatures
within 10 feet of the accursed defiler take 21 (6d6) slashing
damage, or half damage with a successful DC 14 Dexterity
saving throw.
