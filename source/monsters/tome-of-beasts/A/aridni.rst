Aridni
------

*Both more rugged and more ruthless than normal pixies, the aridni
are an especially greedy breed of fey bandits and kidnappers.*

**Pale Archers.** These ashen-faced fey with gray moth wings
fire green-glowing arrows with a sneer and a curse. Aridni prefer
ranged combat whenever possible, and they are quite difficult to
lure into melee. They sometimes accept a personal challenge o
respond to accusations of cowardice.

**Caravan Raiders.** They’ve developed different magical
abilities that aid them well when they raid caravans for captives
to enslave and sell; charming foes into slavery is a favorite tactic.

**Wealth for Status.** They delight in taking plunder from
humans and dwarves, not so much for its own sake but as a sign
of their power over mortals, and their contempt for those who
lack fey blood.
