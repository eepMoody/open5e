   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Open5e
======

Open5e aims to be the best open-source resource for 5e content.

.. Sidebar:: Hey! Stuff is missing!
   :class: missing

   Some content you may be expecting was not released as part of the `5e SRD <http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf>`_,
   so we aren't allowed to include it in this site.

   We are hoping to fill in the gaps using quality homebrew and 3rd party OGL content.
   `Contact us <mailto:gm@5esrd.com>`_ or `make a pull request <http://github.com/eepMoody/open5e>`_ if you know something we should add!

What's this?! New beasts?!
--------------------------

Thanks to the awesome work of contributor `RealDeuce <https://github.com/RealDeuce>`_, the OGL content from Kobold Press's *Tome of Beasts* is now on Open5e!

If you want to thank him, head over to Github and shower him with well-earned praise!
